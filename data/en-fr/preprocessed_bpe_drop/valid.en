have you already s@@ et@@ t@@ led the bill ?
du@@ e to bad weather , the plan@@ e arrived three hours late .

my mother vis@@ its the d@@ enti@@ st &apos;s every other day to get her te@@ et@@ h fi@@ x@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry if I di@@ stu@@ r@@ bed you .

why don &apos;t you let me take a look ?
I am from E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ t .

my son can ne@@ i@@ ther read no@@ r write yet .
it &apos;s as good as done .
how did you hand@@ le the situation ?
does he do any s@@ por@@ ts ?
I can &apos;t believe your m@@ om let you go .
he se@@ em@@ ed to like that .
Sami and Layla were e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly aw@@ ai@@ ting the ar@@ ri@@ v@@ al of their baby .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what had happened .
it &apos;s as if I had always known how it all was going to end .
I saw the fi@@ le .
the c@@ in@@ em@@ a is bur@@ st@@ ing at the se@@ am@@ s .
this job will call for a lot of money .
she is a doctor and also an al@@ p@@ in@@ ist .
in a d@@ em@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , it &apos;s important for the pr@@ ess to be in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent .
it seems that they &apos;re bo@@ red of married life .
the dog des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed the so@@ f@@ a .
ask T@@ r@@ ang if he &apos;s going out this evening .
the food was fin@@ ger @-@ lic@@ king good .
this is always the way it has been .
some people are just we@@ ir@@ d .
we like Tom .
we had a secret meeting .
I &apos;m off to the g@@ y@@ m .
do you care for cl@@ as@@ si@@ cal music ?
everyone is un@@ i@@ qu@@ e .
I hear music .
we really en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed ou@@ r@@ sel@@ ves .
I can &apos;t pay the r@@ ent .
Tom almost always ig@@ n@@ or@@ es my advice .
I want you to l@@ ay back and rel@@ a@@ x .
that &apos;ll make me happy .
look !
why don &apos;t we go out and get drunk ?
I don &apos;t care if you &apos;re busy . please help me now .
I wanted to speak with you first .
this room is cold .
the watch doesn &apos;t work .
I didn &apos;t think that you &apos;d no@@ ti@@ ced .
G@@ e@@ or@@ ge s@@ ent me a birthday c@@ ard .
he worked for a rich man .
H@@ e@@ y , be careful with that !
do you think you and I are comp@@ ati@@ ble ?
I cannot help lo@@ ving her in sp@@ ite of her many f@@ au@@ l@@ ts .
I &apos;m not going to work .
the so@@ c@@ c@@ er game will be played , even if it r@@ ains .
she &apos;s in@@ t@@ ent on going to N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k to study fas@@ hi@@ on .
I don &apos;t have that kind of money .
Mon@@ keys do not compl@@ ain about not having been made into men .
what do you call this an@@ im@@ al in Japanese ?
I &apos;ll turn it into a house .
do you know if Tom can speak French ?
this is the same n@@ ec@@ k@@ la@@ ce that I lost yesterday .
we &apos;d be very interested in what you think .
the r@@ at was killed by Tom with a sti@@ ck .
the in@@ h@@ ab@@ it@@ ants of the is@@ land are t@@ all and strong .
I &apos;ve always wanted to visit T@@ ur@@ key .
I had a to@@ o@@ th@@ a@@ ch@@ e yesterday .
you have no c@@ au@@ se for ang@@ er .
all pre@@ pos@@ i@@ tions take the n@@ om@@ in@@ ative .
is that French ?
the bar@@ om@@ et@@ er is fall@@ ing . it is going to rain .
if there &apos;s anything I can do to help , please let me know .
I have a feeling you &apos;ll be a very good la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
some people are reading some m@@ ag@@ az@@ ines on the train .
let &apos;s take a trip .
I thought I was about to be cap@@ tu@@ red so I r@@ an as fast as I could .
you don &apos;t o@@ we me anything .
is sugar c@@ an@@ e a fruit or a v@@ e@@ g@@ et@@ able ?
I bought a c@@ am@@ er@@ a for thir@@ ty do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s .
the house sto@@ od on the h@@ ill .
it &apos;s kind of com@@ for@@ ting .
I &apos;m lo@@ ad@@ ed .
how did you meet him ?
I thought about you the other day .
he re@@ ad@@ s French .
I slept n@@ ine hours .
no one tru@@ sts her .
why don &apos;t we talk about something else ?
the m@@ a@@ y@@ or ad@@ min@@ i@@ st@@ ers the a@@ f@@ fai@@ r@@ s of the city .
Tom is a ti@@ mi@@ d young man .
she w@@ on@@ dered where S@@ am was and what he was doing .
we &apos;re on the same si@@ de .
things are only going to get wor@@ se .
nothing happened to Mary . she just forgot to call .
that is the thing that con@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ s you .
the f@@ is@@ hing bo@@ at that had been mis@@ sing re@@ turned to its port s@@ a@@ f@@ ely .
I want to stay in the house .
are you afraid of death ?
tomorrow will be even war@@ mer than today .
we eat so we may live .
when is good for you ?
my father was s@@ ad for the whole day as he had lost his w@@ all@@ et .
I don &apos;t care how much you say you love me . I know your feelings for her haven &apos;t changed .
he left home early in the morning so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble .
what the fu@@ ck is going on here ?
the o@@ st@@ rich has win@@ gs , but it cannot f@@ ly .
I was a bit dis@@ appointed .
I lost your phone number .
a ro@@ p@@ e was th@@ ro@@ wn into the water .
it being Sun@@ day , the sho@@ p was closed .
J@@ e@@ an and K@@ ate are tw@@ ins .
who did this ?
how many children do you have ?
it wouldn &apos;t sur@@ pri@@ se me .
are you ser@@ i@@ ously thinking about not going ?
he told the bo@@ ss some co@@ ck@@ am@@ am@@ i@@ e story about being sick and ne@@ e@@ ding days off from work .
read it to me .
is that all you can talk about - the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et ?
I &apos;ll call you back later .
he was cho@@ s@@ en cap@@ t@@ ain .
thank you very much .
she doesn &apos;t understand s@@ ar@@ c@@ as@@ m .
you are either with us , or against us .
you know what they say .
ex@@ cu@@ se me , la@@ di@@ es !
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does .
I have a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .

I &apos;m happy to help .
you &apos;ve been c@@ le@@ ar@@ ed of all char@@ g@@ es .

the con@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ on re@@ ach@@ ed by a study is &quot; people who think their fe@@ et are sm@@ el@@ ly , have sm@@ el@@ ly fe@@ et ; people who think they aren &apos;t , don &apos;t . &quot;
he is f@@ on@@ d of pain@@ ting .
P@@ o@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans never tell us their in@@ n@@ er th@@ ou@@ ghts .
I don &apos;t know who she is .
I &apos;ve got work to do here .
I &apos;ve en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed talking to you .
her job is to t@@ y@@ p@@ e .
Tom was ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted .
you can &apos;t dance , can you ?
I accep@@ t your a@@ po@@ log@@ y .
should I be talking to Tom ?
I need to know where you are .
what did I say yesterday ?
he speaks as if he were an ex@@ per@@ t .
we have a good team and everyone knows it .
I &apos;m watching the mar@@ k@@ et clo@@ sel@@ y .
I have no im@@ ag@@ in@@ ation .
she is good at sk@@ i@@ ing .
keep dri@@ ving .
I don &apos;t need your help anymore .
I &apos;ll see to it .
we &apos;ll talk about this tomorrow .
she is P@@ i@@ er@@ ro@@ t &apos;s sister .
the l@@ ake is de@@ ep@@ est here .
he was s@@ en@@ t@@ en@@ ced to pri@@ son .
an ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed h@@ e@@ al@@ er can li@@ f@@ t cur@@ ses and dis@@ pe@@ l ev@@ il eyes .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to her .
don &apos;t open your u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a in the h@@ all .
let &apos;s go to an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat place and have a big dinner .
are you at@@ t@@ em@@ p@@ ting to bri@@ be me ?
your cri@@ ti@@ c@@ is@@ m is un@@ fai@@ r .
I sp@@ ent the whole day reading a no@@ v@@ el .
do M@@ ar@@ ti@@ ans speak English ?
I &apos;m getting s@@ le@@ ep@@ y . I should &apos;ve gone to bed ear@@ li@@ er last night .
we pic@@ ked flowers together .
it &apos;s no trouble at all .
I liked working with you .
G@@ o@@ o@@ d@@ night .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
he re@@ j@@ ected our off@@ er .
Tom found a job as a me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic .
I &apos;ll have a n@@ ap after lunch .
if he as@@ ks me that question , I won &apos;t answer .
I &apos;m not good @-@ looking .
were you aw@@ ake at 2 : 3@@ 0 last night ?
why don &apos;t you stay a while ?
he r@@ an to his mother in the library .
some water , please .
would you please s@@ low down ?
there &apos;s room inside .
Tom was reading a book while list@@ en@@ ing to music .
Tom needed your help .
we &apos;re all in this together .
may I try it on ?
close your eyes and tell me what you hear .
how does Tom plan to help ?
he &apos;s ad@@ dic@@ ted to j@@ un@@ k food .
you &apos;re all alone .
they ap@@ pro@@ ve .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
I can drive to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of g@@ as .
why don &apos;t you pu@@ l@@ l over ?
why don &apos;t you meet me out f@@ r@@ on@@ t in a few minutes ?
Sami fe@@ el@@ s so scar@@ ed .
it is necessary for you to stop smoking .
I &apos;ve never come ac@@ ro@@ ss such a strange case .
the company has hard and fast ru@@ les against l@@ at@@ en@@ ess .
you go@@ tt@@ a get more or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zed .
she &apos;s a y@@ o@@ g@@ a in@@ s@@ tru@@ c@@ tor .
nobody ever laugh@@ s at my jo@@ k@@ es .
it &apos;s hard to do that .
once a teacher , always a teacher .
Tom was playing go@@ l@@ f that morning .
does your dog bi@@ te ?
I just wanted to see what would happen .
bre@@ a@@ the , d@@ am@@ n you !
what he said made us angry .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
I &apos;m not your ser@@ v@@ ant .
I don &apos;t know whether to c@@ ry or to l@@ au@@ g@@ h .
how come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
what did you do with that ?
A@@ d@@ ding up n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers is very up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
can I make co@@ pi@@ es ?
you won &apos;t die today .
I hi@@ d it s@@ om@@ e@@ where .
Sami has been sick .
are you still up@@ set about what happened ?
she used mar@@ gar@@ ine in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of but@@ ter .
I &apos;ll drive you s@@ om@@ e@@ where .
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
we have to learn all the s@@ on@@ gs before the end of the week .
would you like to visit the city ?
this gu@@ y &apos;s great at p@@ it@@ ching cur@@ v@@ e@@ b@@ all@@ s .
one w@@ ee@@ k@@ end all of the ho@@ tel@@ s in the city were fu@@ l@@ l because there was a large con@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
we still have a few w@@ ee@@ ks left .
she got all flu@@ st@@ ered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her .
there &apos;s less of it , but no less to it .
that hat be@@ comes you .
how long does it take to walk from here to the city h@@ all ?
he dre@@ am@@ ed about his home .
they have a ten @-@ year @-@ old son .
he was leaving then .
I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the l@@ at@@ est .
I don &apos;t think they al@@ low that .
come again ?
I saw the cake you made .
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er .
where are your friends going ?
as the door sli@@ d open , he almost fell on@@ to the pl@@ at@@ for@@ m .
can you use a computer ?
that &apos;s a lot of c@@ as@@ h .
he &apos;s not a bad person .
if I tell him the truth , she will never for@@ give me .
you should have seen her .
some day we &apos;ll take a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
what time do you want me to pic@@ k you up ?
you got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t walk anymore .
I@@ r@@ an is not I@@ ra@@ q .
his de@@ b@@ ts am@@ oun@@ t to two m@@ il@@ li@@ on do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s .
Tom &apos;s eyes were fu@@ l@@ l of tears .
what is today &apos;s date ?
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed you so much , Tom .
should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to f@@ ear .
I just in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed a new word @-@ pro@@ c@@ es@@ so@@ r en@@ ab@@ ling to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce them b@@ ack@@ war@@ ds .
the old man started to l@@ au@@ g@@ h s@@ ad@@ ly .
I &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
who will correct my mist@@ akes ?
do you think it was easy for me ?
I s@@ cre@@ am@@ ed but nobody could hear me .
can anyone drive ?
I am very ill at ea@@ se with str@@ ang@@ ers .
do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two w@@ ee@@ ks have pass@@ ed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t look !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass gu@@ it@@ ar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her be@@ h@@ av@@ i@@ or .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they ad@@ m@@ itted that they &apos;d li@@ ed .
I don &apos;t like swimming in po@@ o@@ ls .
can you understand the me@@ an@@ ing of this sentence ?
the man was hi@@ ding in a den@@ se for@@ est .
I know that this is we@@ ir@@ d .
that would make sense .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings .
what &apos;s the go@@ l@@ d@@ en ru@@ le ?
he can har@@ dly speak any English .
I had my watch m@@ end@@ ed .
we can help you .
are you invol@@ ved in poli@@ ti@@ c@@ s ?
b@@ low out the c@@ and@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t enti@@ r@@ ely sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right choice .
the truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the experience necessary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fire .
but it &apos;s me who should thank you .
he came while I was still as@@ le@@ ep .
I took over the bus@@ iness from F@@ a@@ ther .
o@@ il is expensive .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan an@@ n@@ oun@@ ced that he and L@@ in@@ d@@ a were getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
I have a vis@@ a .
it will be a great pl@@ ea@@ sure for me to trans@@ late the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the lu@@ gg@@ age ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a k@@ id in a c@@ and@@ y store .
M@@ ath@@ s is a good sub@@ ject .
you really speak French well .
for exam@@ p@@ le , more people are cho@@ o@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you ser@@ i@@ ously thinking about going ?
it was a pl@@ ea@@ sure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll die .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment .
I r@@ an outside and the door lo@@ cked it@@ sel@@ f behind me .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ pro@@ du@@ c@@ tive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting im@@ p@@ ati@@ ently .
S@@ p@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ a was a p@@ an@@ the@@ ist .
I like both s@@ ci@@ ence and mat@@ h .
we &apos;re not c@@ er@@ t@@ ain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not im@@ possible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has re@@ qu@@ es@@ ted my as@@ si@@ st@@ ance .
do you want to get us both killed ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing things ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a tr@@ ai@@ ne@@ e .
how much are you being p@@ aid to do this ?
she was loved by everybody in the v@@ ill@@ age .
where do you train your students ?
have you seen my c@@ am@@ er@@ a ?
I hear you were gr@@ oun@@ ded .
this book is too large to go in my po@@ ck@@ et .
could you please over@@ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a bo@@ y@@ friend .
I hate that gu@@ y .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he bor@@ ro@@ wed the car from his friend .
this TV was made in Ch@@ in@@ a .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this p@@ ho@@ to .
would you like to read this m@@ ag@@ az@@ ine ?
he took char@@ ge of the f@@ ir@@ m after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I u@@ su@@ ally talked to each other in French .
I f@@ illed up the v@@ a@@ se with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who s@@ ays that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play ch@@ ess ?
this bicycle is mine . yours is over there .
it &apos;s an em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y !
for me , the real world is just a f@@ ic@@ tion .
speaking of f@@ il@@ ms , why not go to the c@@ in@@ em@@ a tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
will it be fine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
anything you want , my d@@ ear .
she at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ted me at first si@@ ght .
that is the fun@@ ni@@ est jo@@ ke that I have ever heard .
he promis@@ ed to pro@@ vi@@ de information .
I &apos;m taking care of it . you can rel@@ a@@ x . you can r@@ ely on me .
are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just s@@ po@@ ken to your French teacher and he s@@ ays you &apos;re doing well in his class .
everybody &apos;s in a hurry these days .
she likes to go to the library .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it mat@@ ters to me .
the cold air re@@ vi@@ v@@ ed Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she t@@ em@@ p@@ ted him .
everyone can make a differ@@ ence in their own lives and th@@ er@@ e@@ by co@@ ll@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ ely make the world a better place for th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves and others around them .
you &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it later .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once u@@ po@@ n a time there lived an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more coun@@ tri@@ es than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t s@@ pl@@ as@@ h me !
Tom har@@ dly spoke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
there &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G@@ ag@@ n@@ on .
everyone is free to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a gu@@ y ne@@ ar@@ ly r@@ an into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished bus@@ iness .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ ill@@ ing .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
if you would be a good re@@ ad@@ er , read ; if a w@@ ri@@ ter , write .
I hate those sp@@ i@@ der@@ s . they &apos;re always there to f@@ re@@ a@@ k me out when I &apos;m c@@ le@@ an@@ ing .
no such person ex@@ i@@ sts .
do your best !
I gave up hope .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to cut down on smoking .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a jo@@ ke .
can you put the children to bed ?
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e &apos;s hi@@ ding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last S@@ at@@ ur@@ day ?
he wrote a no@@ v@@ el bas@@ ed on an@@ ci@@ ent m@@ y@@ ths .
Tom went ro@@ ck c@@ li@@ m@@ b@@ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this game .
they &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t touch this !
you &apos;ve been war@@ ned .
he plays the piano very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicycle ?
she has good i@@ de@@ as .
what a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble thing !
we have no choice but to give up the whole plan .
you &apos;re a tr@@ ai@@ tor .
we take ri@@ s@@ ks all the time .
Z@@ ai@@ l@@ ai@@ b@@ a b@@ ar is hi@@ ring w@@ ai@@ ters ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li@@ f@@ t my right ar@@ m .
I tried fl@@ ying from the top of the tree .
this pri@@ est is a good man .
I sometimes lie on the gr@@ ass .
Tom thought Mary was safe .
I just want to know why you br@@ ought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
we as@@ su@@ me that he is hon@@ est .
are you all right ?
wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever ro@@ ad you may take , it will l@@ ea@@ d to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ si@@ ble to all who se@@ e@@ k his coun@@ se@@ l .
I &apos;m sorry I mi@@ sun@@ der@@ sto@@ od you .
where can I find a t@@ a@@ x@@ i ?
she &apos;s going through a mi@@ d@@ life cri@@ s@@ is .
the res@@ cu@@ ed re@@ fu@@ g@@ e@@ es were l@@ on@@ g@@ ing for f@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om .
stop su@@ c@@ king up to the teacher .
re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ing the clu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I s@@ om@@ e@@ how man@@ ag@@ ed to get the clu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed so I could just about drive for the time being .
they did not believe me .
we know you &apos;re interested .
the house is bur@@ ning !
we consi@@ der Tom hon@@ est .
I &apos;ll give you a si@@ m@@ p@@ le exam@@ p@@ le .
win@@ ds from the sea are mo@@ ist .
we have arrived safe and sound .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
Mr W@@ il@@ son is pr@@ ou@@ d of his house .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
the meeting will be hel@@ d re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the weather .
in the A@@ r@@ c@@ tic there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
she &apos;s young , n@@ ai@@ ve and in@@ ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed .
