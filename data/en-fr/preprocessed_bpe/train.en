we all had a great time .
I &apos;d like Tom to be happy .
I don &apos;t sup@@ pos@@ e there &apos;s much chance of that happen@@ ing .
H@@ e@@ y , don &apos;t do that !
I understand why .
life is not an ex@@ ac@@ t s@@ ci@@ ence , it is an art .
my mother al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed me to go ab@@ ro@@ ad .
he se@@ ar@@ ched his po@@ ck@@ ets for the key .
I still live at my d@@ ad &apos;s place .
D@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ n is in I@@ rel@@ and .
please put the light out when you leave the room .
I had is@@ su@@ es I had to deal with .
I &apos;m going to start .
she was born lucky .
the h@@ ai@@ l cr@@ acked the window .
if you could do that for me , I &apos;d appreciate it .
some water , please .
I appreciate your telling me .
you will find this in a har@@ d@@ w@@ are store .
these are my grand@@ mother &apos;s ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al te@@ et@@ h .
what is this place ?
no .
where can I get a c@@ a@@ b ?
we had a real good time .
it was kind of fun .
he felt it was his du@@ ty to go .
read between the l@@ ines .
what are some fo@@ ods you u@@ su@@ ally eat with your children ?
the bi@@ gg@@ est con@@ c@@ er@@ n is cost .
a little n@@ ap and , just like that , I &apos;m as f@@ r@@ es@@ h as a d@@ ai@@ s@@ y .
we &apos;ll deal with it in the morning .
we have people ever@@ y@@ where .
you have to pay the pri@@ ce .
we walked more quickly than u@@ su@@ al .
we live .
I hel@@ ped Tom .
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
in order to make this cake you need b@@ a@@ king po@@ w@@ der and un@@ sal@@ ted but@@ ter .
An@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating a cold win@@ ter , we bought a bi@@ g@@ ger sto@@ ve .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t understand .
m@@ em@@ ori@@ ze it well .
co@@ ws are s@@ ac@@ red to many people in In@@ di@@ a .
the ro@@ of is really in need of re@@ p@@ air .
correct er@@ r@@ ors .
they &apos;re brother and sister .
I just wanted to say thank you .
he has very little inter@@ est in his children .
I like K@@ ev@@ in N@@ as@@ h .
how do you for@@ m the pl@@ ur@@ al of n@@ oun@@ s ?
the work is mo@@ st@@ ly done .
Tom talked too much and let the secret sli@@ p .
what are you afraid of ?
Tom killed a man .
I really like you .
your tr@@ ou@@ b@@ les are just begin@@ ning .
can you trans@@ late a love letter ?
I do not know why I said that .
I will per@@ for@@ m my du@@ ties with pl@@ ea@@ sure .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s going to rain .
I &apos;ll tell my d@@ ad !
he got very angry , for she re@@ f@@ used to fol@@ low his advice .
we are not rich .
at@@ om@@ ic en@@ erg@@ y can be used for p@@ ea@@ c@@ e@@ ful ends .
I will go if you go .
stop y@@ el@@ ling .
there are only 1@@ 0 minutes left until the end of the l@@ es@@ son .
Sami has a ride .
she doesn &apos;t want him to pic@@ k the flowers .
I want you to remember this moment .
there used to be a store right here .
two small bo@@ tt@@ les , please .
I knew you had a bo@@ y@@ friend !
there is an ur@@ g@@ ent need for the lo@@ cal go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment to help the hom@@ el@@ ess .
you &apos;ve been had .
there is nothing left to eat .
I can &apos;t st@@ and being tre@@ ated like a child .
I was di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with p@@ n@@ eu@@ mon@@ ia .
rec@@ ently there have been a lot of pro@@ t@@ es@@ ts in the city .
I &apos;ll make you a new su@@ it .
the company is@@ su@@ ed a pr@@ ess rel@@ ea@@ se .
it &apos;s ab@@ sur@@ d of you to do that .
I &apos;m going to take my car .
I wanted to speak to you about this .
have you anything to dec@@ l@@ are ?
he has no bicycle .
are you saying I have no sense of hu@@ mo@@ r ?
today is not so cold .
women have be@@ au@@ ty , but do books not also have be@@ au@@ ty ?
where was your father ?
the inter@@ n is l@@ az@@ y .
I have a little something for you .
I like to in@@ v@@ ent us@@ e@@ ful things .
students study in school .
anyone who is not sho@@ cked by qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m theory has not un@@ der@@ sto@@ od it .
we would have hel@@ ped them .
my TV is broken .
we have enough .
I got into a fi@@ ght .
it is a sup@@ er idea .
don &apos;t tell him I told you .
I had no idea you were invol@@ ved .
for the past few years , te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers who im@@ it@@ ate over@@ we@@ ight am@@ er@@ ic@@ an r@@ ap@@ per@@ s have been w@@ al@@ king like in@@ ver@@ ted p@@ end@@ u@@ lu@@ ms , sw@@ in@@ ging from left to right , which is the only way forward if you we@@ ig@@ h over two hun@@ d@@ red and si@@ x@@ ty po@@ u@@ n@@ ds , but completely in@@ e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ tive if you are a s@@ cr@@ aw@@ ny te@@ en@@ ager we@@ i@@ gh@@ ing half of that , since most of the en@@ erg@@ y is was@@ ted on si@@ de ste@@ ps , not to m@@ en@@ tion the sh@@ e@@ er ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ty of that sw@@ in@@ ging g@@ ai@@ t .
Sami &apos;s plan@@ e hasn &apos;t even taken off .
you should have s@@ po@@ ken more poli@@ tel@@ y .
if it &apos;s that hot , how about you take off all your clothes ?
I don &apos;t have a ti@@ ck@@ et .
she is my mother @-@ in @-@ la@@ w .
Tom wasn &apos;t wearing shoes .
bring me a cu@@ p of coffee , please .
so , what else is going on ?
you will find the restaurant on your right .
is Tom still playing ?
two th@@ ou@@ s@@ and people f@@ it into this h@@ all .
he has this large room to himself .
don &apos;t you ever come here again !
I got into trouble with the police by dri@@ ving too fast .
a s@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c theory is a h@@ y@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is that has been pro@@ ved by t@@ es@@ ting .
they were all here .
I think that you have been br@@ ain@@ was@@ hed .
hand me my mu@@ g .
buy four big po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es for me .
I sw@@ ear to God this is true .
I thought I had a good chance .
he told me that his father &apos;s a teacher .
he wasn &apos;t a good mus@@ ici@@ an .
in the cen@@ ter of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity c@@ am@@ p@@ us st@@ and@@ s the st@@ at@@ u@@ e of the f@@ oun@@ der .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
I know who he is .
really ? I thought she &apos;d be the last person to get married .
I wonder why I didn &apos;t think of that .
we exp@@ ect heavy res@@ i@@ st@@ ance .
I &apos;ll try to pay this bill tomorrow .
Tom left everything to Mary in his will .
I &apos;m not as smart as you .
we need a pass@@ word to use this computer .
du@@ ring the F@@ ir@@ st W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar &quot; An@@ n@@ e of G@@ re@@ en G@@ ab@@ les &quot; was dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted by the P@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ h go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment to tro@@ o@@ ps in the tr@@ en@@ ches to re@@ mind them of what they were fi@@ gh@@ ting for .
pri@@ ces are high .
would you be friends with me ?
I can &apos;t go out because I have a lot of hom@@ e@@ work .
if you get bit by a r@@ ab@@ id dog , you &apos;ll need a t@@ et@@ an@@ us shot .
I &apos;m not ready for this .
I agree with what you say to some ex@@ t@@ ent .
he put the key in the lo@@ ck .
this time , you &apos;ve gone too far .
they were not im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
I &apos;ve never vo@@ ted .
let me hand@@ le it .
how much r@@ ent do you pay for the a@@ par@@ t@@ ment ?
I can har@@ dly bre@@ a@@ the .
don &apos;t try the p@@ ati@@ ence of God !
is there a student dis@@ coun@@ t ?
I hope you have in@@ sur@@ ance .
when will your new no@@ v@@ el come out ?
I go to school at s@@ even thir@@ ty .
it is nothing to me .
tea@@ ching is learning .
I close my eyes , but I &apos;m s@@ em@@ i @-@ aw@@ ake .
we will meet again .
O@@ K , very good .
you should stay in the hospital for tre@@ at@@ ment .
could you please tell me again who your father is ?
do you have a b@@ ack@@ up plan ?
everyone started laugh@@ ing .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
I even wrote a letter to her .
what &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
we have way too much work to do .
he is de@@ e@@ pl@@ y att@@ ach@@ ed to her .
he is not such a n@@ as@@ ty f@@ el@@ low as you think .
I &apos;m happy you liked it .
we have come a long way .
this is my fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ te sub@@ ject .
how many languages are s@@ po@@ ken wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ?
in a man@@ n@@ er of speaking , yes .
now drink up .
I as@@ sure you this is about much more than money .
did you forget to do your hom@@ e@@ work ?
I &apos;ve got a br@@ and new bi@@ ke .
Tom knew what Mary had done .
he is h@@ ated by all .
I don &apos;t bi@@ te .
this will only take a second .
Tom and Mary are living in France since yesterday .
we lost .
he went into re@@ h@@ a@@ b .
we must think about these pl@@ ans in ter@@ ms of what they would cost .
he &apos;s feeling much better .
Tom sin@@ gs in a ch@@ ur@@ ch cho@@ i@@ r .
he felt un@@ easy in his father &apos;s pres@@ ence .
am I the only one who didn &apos;t understand what was going on ?
the st@@ or@@ m did great d@@ am@@ age to her pro@@ per@@ ty .
I &apos;m sorry for the pain I c@@ au@@ s@@ ed you and your family .
I lost my wife in a tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic accident .
nothing has gone right all day .
make h@@ as@@ te .
you &apos;re very ti@@ mi@@ d .
we &apos;re all in this together .
he dro@@ pped the an@@ cho@@ vi@@ es .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
do you mind if we come in ?
it &apos;s very cold , this win@@ ter !
this is bad .
as far as I am con@@ c@@ er@@ ned , I am not against your opinion .
he sel@@ d@@ om or@@ der@@ s anything new .
I quite co@@ tt@@ oned on to that man .
he came running .
he is not himself today .
it &apos;s not going to be easy to finish this job on time .
this is going to happen a lot from now on .
this o@@ il well has been su@@ c@@ ked d@@ ry .
that &apos;s told him !
Dan dr@@ ag@@ g@@ ed L@@ in@@ d@@ a out of the house and thre@@ w her in the stre@@ et .
I &apos;m not tired right now .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happen@@ ing .
now you listen to me !
you &apos;ll feel better in a few hours .
I &apos;m very l@@ az@@ y .
you &apos;re n@@ u@@ ts !
Tom des@@ er@@ ves p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment .
what do you think happened to Tom ?
it &apos;s like being in a c@@ and@@ y store .
this evening we will go to ch@@ ur@@ ch .
it &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
there were a lot of girls at the party .
come to help me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was afraid of g@@ ho@@ sts .
he is well @-@ liked .
I ad@@ ded his name to the li@@ st .
thank you for your e@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ ts .
I need to see you in my office .
the co@@ sts are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
don &apos;t m@@ ess with me !
I feel very str@@ on@@ g@@ ly about that .
she ow@@ es me money .
can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
this little girl lives in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I feel like someone just walked over my gr@@ av@@ e .
give me ch@@ ap@@ ter and ver@@ se .
can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
our gar@@ d@@ en pro@@ du@@ ced an ab@@ un@@ dance of c@@ ab@@ b@@ ages last year .
why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t st@@ and this hot weather .
give us the det@@ ails .
she w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was tr@@ app@@ ed in a vi@@ ci@@ ous ci@@ r@@ c@@ le .
Mary &apos;s sister knew all about Tom &apos;s s@@ ec@@ re@@ ts .
you should be more careful the next time .
Tom makes a lot of mist@@ akes .
it will be ready soon .
there &apos;s a com@@ par@@ ati@@ v@@ ely large c@@ in@@ em@@ a compl@@ e@@ x inside the m@@ all .
who &apos;s hi@@ ding behind the cur@@ t@@ ain ?
ob@@ vi@@ ously , you vo@@ l@@ un@@ te@@ ered .
see life in ter@@ ms of po@@ wer .
the weather is good .
do you really want to win ?
most of them ur@@ g@@ ed him to take the job .
Sami came to give Layla her gi@@ f@@ t .
nothing was fun@@ ny .
I never loved you .
let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is bor@@ ing , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
we are living through a bi@@ o@@ di@@ ver@@ s@@ ity cri@@ s@@ is .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
he &apos;s working at his English .
they live on the floor b@@ en@@ e@@ at@@ h .
there is a pon@@ d in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the park .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
she speaks too much .
no t@@ a@@ x@@ i stop@@ ped .
you must not stop on the hard sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der to go to the to@@ il@@ et .
something is wrong with the eng@@ ine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom gets up@@ set easily .
this man is a le@@ g@@ end .
enjoy your m@@ ea@@ l ! did you already start ?
you &apos;re a s@@ no@@ b .
I fi@@ gu@@ red I could coun@@ t on you .
we &apos;d like another bo@@ tt@@ le of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner ser@@ ved ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always for@@ getting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the pri@@ ce is re@@ as@@ on@@ able .
In@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ es in@@ cre@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly became g@@ ear@@ ed for ou@@ ter sp@@ a@@ ce .
she likes no one and no one likes her .
just pre@@ t@@ en@@ d you don &apos;t know me .
the name of my country is written without any ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le .
the in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ al@@ is@@ ed world is used to using water pro@@ f@@ li@@ g@@ ately .
thank you for your det@@ ai@@ led ex@@ plan@@ ation .
you &apos;re my her@@ o , Sami .
my legs are wea@@ k .
she doesn &apos;t know the ti@@ t@@ le of the book you &apos;re talking about .
let &apos;s talk sho@@ p for a while .
she po@@ u@@ red the milk into a bo@@ w@@ l .
run hot water into the b@@ at@@ h .
she tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .
may I have your order , please ?
the ra@@ di@@ o is a bit l@@ ou@@ d .
Mary is a y@@ o@@ del@@ er .
he kept on laugh@@ ing at me .
I could tell you about be@@ e@@ kee@@ ping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bo@@ re you .
don &apos;t all speak at once .
it was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at fu@@ r@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ re we can &apos;t a@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ d .
he wants you to come home .
you &apos;re early .
I found the em@@ p@@ ty box .
she made him rich .
he was standing at the top of the mountain .
she le@@ an@@ ed to@@ war@@ ds me .
this is what I wanted .
you re@@ mind me of myself when I was your age .
these pi@@ ec@@ es of fu@@ r@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ re are not for s@@ a@@ le .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am learning German .
please close the door behind you .
have you made a li@@ st yet ?
without o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , all an@@ im@@ als would have dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed long ago .
why &apos;s Tom still here ?
we need money .
it &apos;s my f@@ au@@ l@@ t , not yours .
no one is am@@ used .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
while we were having te@@ a , there was an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
either they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
what is in your hands ?
we need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the mar@@ k@@ et .
it was one of the most re@@ war@@ ding ex@@ per@@ i@@ ences of my life .
he is respon@@ si@@ ble for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing doing that .
I can think of s@@ ever@@ al re@@ as@@ ons .
you might get hurt .
you &apos;re the only one who can help .
when was the last time you talked to Tom ?
do you really think Tom is happy ?
you &apos;ve been in@@ f@@ ected .
there were six sh@@ ee@@ p in the fi@@ el@@ d .
are you thinking about getting a job ?
I &apos;m still not sure .
if you fe@@ ed your dog pro@@ per@@ ly , you can in@@ cre@@ a@@ se his li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
the stre@@ et in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of my house is pretty n@@ ar@@ row .
when are we going to leave ?
my br@@ ain is fri@@ ed .
a new ro@@ ad is under con@@ s@@ tru@@ c@@ tion .
Tom had a little accident .
they kept drin@@ king .
did you read it enti@@ r@@ ely ?
she &apos;s two years y@@ oun@@ ger than him .
our teacher often over@@ looked his name on the li@@ st .
Tom still ow@@ es me a lot of money .
get the h@@ ell out my way !
be careful !
the po@@ pu@@ l@@ ation of Japan is l@@ ar@@ ger than that of N@@ e@@ w Z@@ e@@ al@@ and .
I &apos;d prefer not to eat that .
the pri@@ ce ro@@ se .
the pain has l@@ ess@@ en@@ ed a little .
I wish I could ex@@ plain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my keys ?
that &apos;s ter@@ ri@@ ble advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s ab@@ so@@ lu@@ te n@@ on@@ sense !
the teacher p@@ un@@ is@@ hed her students for using bad words .
how can you ac@@ cu@@ se me of such a thing ? I would never l@@ ay a hand on my child .
Tom is thir@@ st@@ y .
he has a S@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n acc@@ ent .
don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
the problem is the@@ ir@@ s .
in times of cri@@ s@@ is one should never i@@ de@@ ali@@ se the past .
you can &apos;t sit there .
I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a in the c@@ a@@ b .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s c@@ ou@@ s@@ in .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .
no one has ever seen God .
some tea@@ ch@@ ers have a great e@@ f@@ f@@ ect on their students .
we &apos;re old friends .
we av@@ o@@ id talking about poli@@ ti@@ c@@ s .
I am not av@@ ai@@ l@@ able .
do you believe in Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity ?
n@@ one of these car@@ s are mine .
please m@@ ai@@ l this letter on your next trip to the pos@@ t office .
you still have a lot to learn .
I want to get back .
I &apos;m sorry that I couldn &apos;t live up to your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
you can go if you want to .
I am con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that he is in@@ no@@ c@@ ent .
do all of you speak French ?
is this wine from A@@ r@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ a ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom and Mary are waiting for .
there &apos;s no w@@ in@@ d today .
there were no f@@ en@@ ces on the great pl@@ ains .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I think it would have been a better sho@@ o@@ t with a 1@@ 0@@ m@@ m l@@ ens .
gen@@ i@@ us is only one re@@ mo@@ ve from in@@ s@@ an@@ ity .
I &apos;m going to show you the p@@ ho@@ to .
get rich !
everything is going fine .
you may cho@@ o@@ se any book you like .
girl as she was , J@@ o@@ an was not d@@ au@@ n@@ ted at all .
I have a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h idea what needs to be done .
you can ad@@ d whatever to@@ p@@ p@@ ings you like to the pi@@ z@@ z@@ a .
I had never seen such a sh@@ in@@ y st@@ ar .
I want your name and b@@ ad@@ ge number .
could I have the bill , please ?
he is too drunk to drive home .
experience is the best teacher .
Tom was on TV yesterday .
pain@@ ting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
how did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
food is necessary for life .
that s@@ ounds good !
we char@@ ter@@ ed a bus .
ask me again some other time .
I don &apos;t want to up@@ set you .
I can &apos;t wait .
rec@@ ently the number of car@@ s has gre@@ at@@ ly in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed .
you &apos;ve om@@ itted the pre@@ pos@@ i@@ tion in this sentence .
enjoy yourself to the fu@@ ll@@ est .
Tom told me that he h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
T@@ ok@@ y@@ o is a very expensive place to live .
don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bo@@ red . let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom in@@ tend@@ ed to do that .
the f@@ ir@@ m has its head office in O@@ s@@ a@@ k@@ a .
today , I was with a friend at the swimming po@@ ol .
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee .
I made him sw@@ ee@@ p the floor .
I don &apos;t have those an@@ sw@@ ers .
my daughter likes to play with do@@ ll@@ s .
have you ever been there ?
are you through with your work ?
you can &apos;t just leave your car par@@ ked in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of the fire h@@ y@@ dr@@ ant .
I thought that you were going to wait for me .
can cats really see in the dark ?
one min@@ u@@ te has si@@ x@@ ty se@@ con@@ ds .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s changed .
I &apos;ve had a perf@@ ec@@ tly wonder@@ ful evening . but this wasn &apos;t it .
keep your g@@ u@@ n hand@@ y .
my name is H@@ op@@ k@@ ins .
Tom wo@@ ke up with h@@ ear@@ t@@ bur@@ n .
he has written a letter .
why are you wor@@ ried ?
I don &apos;t remember m@@ ai@@ ling the letter .
is all of this money yours ?
in 1@@ 9@@ 1@@ 2 , the A@@ u@@ st@@ ri@@ an t@@ ai@@ lo@@ r F@@ r@@ an@@ z R@@ ei@@ ch@@ el@@ t died ju@@ m@@ ping off the first floor of the E@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ el T@@ o@@ wer while trying out his new in@@ v@@ en@@ tion , the par@@ ach@@ u@@ te coat , which did not work ...
Tom has cho@@ s@@ en you .
I thought you were at work .
it was a very , very hot night .
everyone out !
why are you dr@@ ying your hair ?
she didn &apos;t show up .
you seem happy .
there was no sw@@ el@@ ling .
my dog sometimes e@@ ats gr@@ ass .
why are you so interested ?
no com@@ ment .
he is a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an .
you &apos;re very ti@@ mi@@ d .
I have a red home .
the teacher can see you .
nobody knows exactly how many r@@ ac@@ es make up the po@@ pu@@ l@@ ation of the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
the tre@@ es will soon be b@@ are .
I thought she was stupid .
I aw@@ o@@ ke to find everything had been a dre@@ am .
she knows her@@ sel@@ f well .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
do you eat ri@@ ce every day ?
har@@ dly had he en@@ ter@@ ed the room , when she bur@@ st into tears .
I &apos;m not as afraid of h@@ e@@ i@@ ghts as I used to be .
you &apos;ll be safe with her .
how long does it take by car ?
can we get some help ?
you must take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of the op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity .
I opened a bo@@ tt@@ le of red wine .
you have a great im@@ ag@@ in@@ ation .
she vo@@ l@@ un@@ te@@ ered to go to the meeting with him .
she &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your pl@@ ate .
I ad@@ m@@ it I was surprised .
when will you re@@ turn ?
you can &apos;t just come in here and start or@@ der@@ ing people around .
what is the use of ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y ?
I was us@@ her@@ ed to my se@@ at .
I had something plan@@ ned .
Tom has tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed around the world .
Tom never gave up .
I don &apos;t really want to have another child .
the n@@ u@@ n pr@@ a@@ y@@ ed and cro@@ s@@ sed her@@ sel@@ f .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him where he should stay .
new bl@@ an@@ k@@ ets were dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ ted to the poor .
tell them what happened .
it did not come off .
I promise you I &apos;ll keep you safe .
it isn &apos;t expensive .
H@@ o@@ ly Tom !
here is a letter for you .
he &apos;s be@@ ating me , three to z@@ i@@ p .
they all en@@ ter@@ ed .
the go@@ l@@ d@@ fish is ali@@ ve .
she ur@@ g@@ ed him to consi@@ der the re@@ qu@@ est .
it &apos;ll be easy to find someone to do that .
like it ?
you didn &apos;t let me answer .
G@@ re@@ et@@ ings , str@@ ang@@ er .
have you seen him before ?
the tree fell over in the t@@ y@@ p@@ ho@@ on .

there are 1@@ 0 t@@ y@@ p@@ es of people in the world : those who understand b@@ in@@ ary , and those who don &apos;t .
I was hi@@ dd@@ en .
we almost f@@ ro@@ ze to death .
I never felt com@@ for@@ table around your parents .
there was b@@ lo@@ od on Tom &apos;s shirt .
he is a po@@ et of a s@@ or@@ t .
give me your address .
Tom and Mary were in love with each other .
S@@ and@@ r@@ a has g@@ ro@@ wn up to be a beautiful woman .
I &apos;d su@@ gg@@ est that you clean up a bit before your mother gets here .
here &apos;s where the fun beg@@ ins .
could you ad@@ d me ?
I sup@@ pos@@ e we have nothing to lose .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is invol@@ ved in a cri@@ me .
if your answer is correct , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their hon@@ e@@ y@@ mo@@ on in a fore@@ ig@@ n land .
we tried to che@@ er her up .
they bur@@ ned all the do@@ cu@@ m@@ ents .
you &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one believ@@ ed you .
the h@@ all was dec@@ or@@ ated with Japanese pain@@ t@@ ings .
if I were in your place , I would l@@ end him a hand .
nobody su@@ sp@@ ected anything .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
she made me hurry .
they ir@@ oned out their differ@@ ences .
these aren &apos;t my keys .
we are having lunch .
a g@@ ro@@ wing child re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es more food .
how long did they live in E@@ n@@ gl@@ and ?
how is your daughter ?
it &apos;s lunch time .
see what happen@@ s when you give people advice ?
it &apos;s time for us to get ready .
if he doesn &apos;t come , we won &apos;t go .
what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at least w@@ ill@@ ing to consi@@ der the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of other al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves .
you don &apos;t have to come .
I can fin@@ ally see the light at the end of the t@@ un@@ ne@@ l .
I was completely d@@ ev@@ as@@ t@@ ated .
he turned his th@@ ou@@ ghts to@@ ward home .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
I asked Tom if he needed more money .
Tom knows that he can win .
I am very tired from the hard work .
I &apos;ve already told everybody to go home .
Tom never re@@ ach@@ ed Australi@@ a .
we should have set off ear@@ li@@ er .
I me@@ an to go tomorrow if the weather is fine .
may comes after A@@ pri@@ l .
his death was a great lo@@ ss to our f@@ ir@@ m .
my ol@@ der brother is an au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty on ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
everybody needs to c@@ al@@ m down .
there &apos;s a great restaurant around the c@@ or@@ n@@ er .
children f@@ illed the room .
why wouldn &apos;t you let me tell you what happened ?
it &apos;s rain@@ ing cats and do@@ gs .
it &apos;s an ex@@ cu@@ se .
I think so .
you look n@@ er@@ v@@ ous .
I like being alone .
I have a few easy questions for you .
hurry up , girls .
do you think this j@@ el@@ ly &apos;s f@@ ir@@ m enough to eat yet ?
I was on a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
he was my mat@@ h teacher .
you &apos;re cr@@ a@@ f@@ ty .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between a vi@@ r@@ us and a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia .
what do you want to talk to me about ?
the boy was se@@ ar@@ ching for the lost key .
sugar dis@@ sol@@ ves in water .
it felt pretty good .
do you have a table on the p@@ ati@@ o ?
you &apos;ll find this l@@ es@@ son easy .
believe me . I &apos;ll be a new man .
if only I could already speak German flu@@ ently !
I want you to have a job that you love .
are Tom and Mary sure ?
I still don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom was like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .
be on your gu@@ ard against pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets .
the girls are exc@@ ited .
what time &apos;s your train ?
he sp@@ u@@ n her around , took her in his ar@@ ms , di@@ pped her back , and gave her a big H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od kis@@ s .
Tom is u@@ su@@ ally very qu@@ i@@ et , isn &apos;t he ?
why is au@@ tu@@ m@@ n called &quot; f@@ all &quot; in Americ@@ a ?
in my opinion , he is correct .
I have enough money to buy it .
are there any b@@ an@@ an@@ as ?
he is a s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st .
Tom wanted me to learn French .
the C@@ old W@@ ar end@@ ed when the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et U@@ ni@@ on co@@ ll@@ ap@@ sed .
we have to do this .
your wish is a comm@@ and for me .
he would not take the money .
she made a lot of money .
this app@@ le is s@@ our .
did you have a pl@@ e@@ as@@ ant trip ?
Tom never gi@@ ves anything to anybody .
H@@ el@@ en K@@ el@@ l@@ er was bl@@ in@@ d , d@@ ea@@ f and du@@ m@@ b .
she didn &apos;t exactly agree with me .
I am wonder@@ ing if I could be of any ser@@ vi@@ ce to you .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
I like all of the s@@ on@@ gs Tom sin@@ gs .
D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ es@@ tr@@ ate your clo@@ ck to see how time f@@ lies .
Tom has a black cat .
an@@ y@@ way , if you want to know more about my country , I &apos;ll send you a letter when I get home .
children play in this park every day .
it r@@ ains so@@ f@@ tly on the city .
more and more young people are going under the kni@@ f@@ e to im@@ pro@@ ve their ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal appe@@ ar@@ ance .
I would like to tr@@ av@@ el alone .
she is more char@@ m@@ ing that the others .
it &apos;s your dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance that makes you completely in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ able .
he gets a h@@ ai@@ r@@ cut three times a month .
the l@@ em@@ on@@ ade is cold .
are you busy F@@ ri@@ day night ?
if you rest , you will be back on your fe@@ et again soon .
please , wash your hands .
Tom gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ated .
I can &apos;t wait to meet you .
where did you g@@ row up ?
she d@@ anced all night long .
that &apos;s how he likes it .
he dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed a new st@@ ar .
what does he want ?
these things aren &apos;t mine !
will they go out tomorrow ?
we want to go to France .
are you going to s@@ av@@ e us ?
I cannot stop thinking of the sto@@ l@@ en money .
what are some fo@@ ods you only eat in the evening ?
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers say that it &apos;s e@@ as@@ i@@ er to lose we@@ ight if you eat three squ@@ are me@@ als a day .
a B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h @-@ Australi@@ an couple fell to their d@@ ea@@ ths in P@@ or@@ tu@@ g@@ al after trying to take a sel@@ f@@ i@@ e from a 3@@ 0 m@@ et@@ re high w@@ all over@@ looking the b@@ each .
the children got lost in the wo@@ ods .
I know you &apos;re tired , but w@@ ake up !
I tried to trans@@ late the sentence &quot; T@@ he cat s@@ ays &apos; me@@ o@@ w &apos; &quot; into five languages , but n@@ one of the trans@@ l@@ ations were correct .
it won &apos;t take that long .
where do you keep the bo@@ o@@ ze ?
A@@ h yes ! you un@@ der@@ sto@@ od everything .
don &apos;t ever make me wait again .
you look good in that su@@ it .
the boy kis@@ sed the girl .
my father gave it to me when I was a k@@ id .
why did Tom call you ?
he seems quite happy .
I &apos;ll call if I hear anything .
you &apos;re fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ing me .
we &apos;re ready to go .
co@@ ws give us milk .
are was@@ ps po@@ is@@ on@@ ous ?
why do co@@ ws ru@@ min@@ ate ?
you are wrong .
I wrote it .
G@@ r@@ and@@ children are pro@@ of that some good comes from having children .
sh@@ ame on those who think ill of it .
my grand@@ father died in the same room in which he was born .
I ac@@ ted like I didn &apos;t know him .
I was trying to be sup@@ por@@ tive .
I &apos;m not good at dr@@ aw@@ ing .
don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate if you need something .
I thought there was a pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that Tom was going to break the contr@@ act .
we might need to help Tom .
he ag@@ re@@ ed to give us an inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w .
I don &apos;t know why I thought it would be different this time .
S@@ har@@ ks are s@@ en@@ si@@ tive to el@@ ec@@ tri@@ cal im@@ pu@@ l@@ ses as well as sound .
I like sleeping .
I &apos;m sorry about last night .
they can speak German .
E@@ n@@ gl@@ and es@@ t@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed many co@@ l@@ on@@ ies .
money is the go@@ d of the hu@@ man ra@@ ce .
he has lived here for one week .
Tom told me he was det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to do that .
S@@ us@@ an sh@@ in@@ ed her father &apos;s shoes .
do you think he &apos;s s@@ en@@ si@@ ble ?
he tu@@ cked the hand@@ k@@ er@@ ch@@ i@@ ef in his po@@ ck@@ et .
let &apos;s see ...
I ad@@ mi@@ re your det@@ er@@ min@@ ation .
I &apos;ve never seen my cat act like that .

the old an@@ ti@@ ph@@ on came back .
don &apos;t you think we des@@ er@@ ve Tom &apos;s res@@ p@@ ect ?
please be poli@@ te .
they were surprised by what they saw .
I &apos;m not m@@ ad .
I don &apos;t hear anything .
we want Tom to sing with us .
the app@@ le does not f@@ all far from the tr@@ un@@ k .
they told me they wanted to leave .
the poli@@ c@@ em@@ an vis@@ ited all the h@@ ou@@ ses .
speak s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , please .
D@@ r@@ . Y@@ u@@ k@@ aw@@ a played an important part in the s@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c study .
S@@ us@@ an is a good cook .
can one better b@@ ear the s@@ ins of an a@@ the@@ ist ?
he found the door closed .
they gre@@ w f@@ on@@ der of each other as time went by .
tell me who did this .
this is bad news .
there &apos;s no to@@ il@@ et paper !
I can &apos;t tell you what to do .
the p@@ ati@@ ent fin@@ ally con@@ qu@@ ered his ill@@ ness .
you should &apos;ve told Tom that a long time ago .
they are am@@ ong us !
I know that you &apos;re smart .
I often go to the sea .
what is her sho@@ e si@@ ze ?
I want to buy a shirt for my little brother .
any chance of us getting ap@@ pro@@ ved ?
all that has changed now .
I wonder if it really was a co@@ in@@ ci@@ d@@ ence .
I am ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed to living alone .
where can I r@@ ent a co@@ stu@@ me ?
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are God &apos;s p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ment for having se@@ x .
T@@ ur@@ t@@ le do@@ ves have a great li@@ king for sun@@ f@@ lo@@ w@@ er se@@ e@@ ds .
I had no idea you were so young .
a house without books is like a room without win@@ do@@ ws .
he hel@@ d out his hand .
this b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its no one .
whatever happen@@ s , I want you to know that I love you .
she told him that it would rain all day .
there are a lot of t@@ at@@ to@@ o@@ s on his body .
in the early days people comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ated by smoke si@@ g@@ n@@ als .
I have lo@@ ts of money .
you don &apos;t have a heart .
we want you to take it .
why can &apos;t I love them both ?
did you know &quot; cre@@ du@@ l@@ ous &quot; is not in the dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary ?
I would like to learn to speak English with con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence .
I &apos;m a sin@@ g@@ le child .
if women knew how much we miss them , they would leave so@@ on@@ er .
I have often ad@@ mi@@ red the m@@ y@@ sti@@ cal way of P@@ y@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as , and the secret M@@ ag@@ ic of n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers .
was anybody here while I was out ?
my mo@@ t@@ to is : com@@ for@@ t the a@@ f@@ f@@ lic@@ ted and a@@ f@@ f@@ lic@@ t the com@@ for@@ table .
I r@@ ar@@ ely see him on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et .
what has he done ?
please tell me .
you have to be pre@@ par@@ ed .
it &apos;s not much of a sur@@ pri@@ se , is it ?
the cu@@ p broke when it fell off the table .
down came the rain in t@@ or@@ r@@ en@@ ts .
I do sy@@ m@@ p@@ ath@@ i@@ ze with you .
when are you going to ask her ?
water bo@@ il@@ s at a t@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ ure of 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es c@@ enti@@ gr@@ ade .
that doesn &apos;t worry me at all .
I looked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
all of them say so , but I believe n@@ one of them .
the her@@ o@@ in isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
whatever you do , don &apos;t s@@ mi@@ le .
it would be better for both of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
women are ph@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ ally wea@@ k@@ er than men .
I feel like such an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
what have you done today ?
I arrived on the night he left .
her feelings are easily hurt .
I know it was an accident .
there are many pi@@ g@@ e@@ ons in the C@@ ity S@@ qu@@ are .
know th@@ y@@ sel@@ f !
are you list@@ en@@ ing clo@@ sel@@ y ?
I don &apos;t know what to say to make you feel better .
I can &apos;t remember where this little do@@ o@@ d@@ ad goes .
call if you need me .
the doctor exam@@ in@@ ed over fi@@ f@@ ty p@@ ati@@ ents that day .
even my grand@@ m@@ a can send an S@@ M@@ S .
she tel@@ ls her t@@ a@@ le of mis@@ er@@ y to everyone she me@@ ets .
you look like a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
would you like a little help ?
I knew you &apos;d know where to find Tom .
I &apos;m glad I learned English .
we can &apos;t do this again .
are you hurt ?
that &apos;s the reason she &apos;s late .
I was speaking to you .
he has over@@ st@@ ep@@ ped his au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
p@@ ush the bu@@ tt@@ on here .
sol@@ der@@ ing S@@ M@@ T com@@ pon@@ ents re@@ qu@@ ir@@ es a bit more experience than sol@@ der@@ ing through @-@ ho@@ le com@@ pon@@ ents .
I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my favorite sub@@ ject in high school .
it would be better if you work this afternoon .
if for some reason that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami slept in his t@@ ent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expensive as I exp@@ ected it to be .
they appointed him as a di@@ rec@@ tor .
almost everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one large fo@@ o@@ t@@ pr@@ in@@ t and a couple of different si@@ ze sm@@ aller fo@@ o@@ t@@ pr@@ in@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sense ?
they were taken pri@@ s@@ on@@ er .
what is the t@@ all@@ est mountain in E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e ?
Tom lost his glasses s@@ om@@ e@@ where in the gar@@ d@@ en .
he has been to France .
you can take wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever ro@@ ad you like .
S@@ ally rec@@ all@@ ed the days when her grand@@ m@@ a was strong and h@@ e@@ al@@ thy .
why don &apos;t you ask Mr W@@ hi@@ te ?
try to be more p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al from now on .
when I run , I get sw@@ e@@ at@@ y .
I have to go .
have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already f@@ illed out the for@@ m .
bring an u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d prefer to die rather than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to talk about his life in the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be fine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts , do you ?
Tom bur@@ st out laugh@@ ing .
I can not a@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ d to buy a used car .
we caught him red @-@ hand@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for p@@ ati@@ ence .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ement for him .
it &apos;s c@@ al@@ m .
she was hit by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same dec@@ is@@ i@@ on I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
I have a large be@@ d@@ room .
let the cat out .
I fin@@ ally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of compl@@ ain@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ h@@ av@@ es .
we &apos;re not invited .
you need to f@@ il@@ ter the ou@@ t@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to dis@@ play only the l@@ ines with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; inside .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball near the win@@ do@@ ws .
the Earth is like a ball with a large m@@ ag@@ n@@ et inside .
that &apos;s just what I needed .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want fu@@ r@@ ther information .
I could har@@ dly end@@ ure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful but@@ ter@@ f@@ ly .
French was the language of di@@ pl@@ om@@ ac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your h@@ ou@@ r@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a F@@ r@@ en@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his acc@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grand@@ father have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of kids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fruit .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar con@@ ju@@ g@@ ation in all languages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ e@@ re building .
have you already eaten ?
it &apos;s really aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
he always takes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true w@@ ar@@ ri@@ or .
Tom needs lo@@ ts of c@@ ou@@ r@@ age and per@@ s@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ e .
thank you for in@@ v@@ it@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is sil@@ ent and w@@ ag@@ s its t@@ ai@@ l .
what did you just say ?
they make a great team .
the se@@ par@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding .
the bicycle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et as a res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce for my res@@ ear@@ ch .
he said he was poor .
she thinks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this dr@@ aw@@ ing took me five minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your ru@@ les .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news c@@ al@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re was@@ ting time .
what did you get hit with ?
car@@ s are expensive .
they were not im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his per@@ mis@@ sion .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ at@@ a in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expensive en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is t@@ wi@@ ce as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the date yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my shoes on .
Tom is an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the w@@ ar@@ ri@@ or .
you are not the only one respon@@ si@@ ble for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to tr@@ av@@ el with only one su@@ it@@ case .
you &apos;re was@@ ting both of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the stars for n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation .
his sal@@ ary is too low to sup@@ port his family on .
this is a very time @-@ con@@ su@@ m@@ ing t@@ ask .
your phone is r@@ in@@ ging again .
Tom wants to marry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a pi@@ e@@ ce of p@@ i@@ e .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a v@@ ill@@ age .
let &apos;s walk a little fas@@ ter .
I know exactly where I am .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was ei@@ ght years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a hu@@ ge mistake .
breakfast is ser@@ ved .
this is il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the mo@@ od to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without saying go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ?
we man@@ ag@@ ed to swim ac@@ ro@@ ss the river .
Mary wants to bre@@ as@@ t@@ fe@@ ed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for l@@ on@@ el@@ iness ?
would you mind speaking more s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom po@@ in@@ ted out my mistake .
the p@@ a@@ tro@@ l@@ man mo@@ ti@@ on@@ ed me to pu@@ l@@ l over .
I &apos;ll send you a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the la@@ w .
she has no less than ten children .
all that g@@ list@@ ers is not go@@ ld .
one of the gu@@ ar@@ ds is dead .
you o@@ we it to yourself to do it .
parents must pro@@ vi@@ de their children with pro@@ per food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are supposed to o@@ be@@ y the la@@ w .
whatever you do , don &apos;t p@@ ush that bu@@ tt@@ on .
I love the ou@@ t@@ f@@ it you &apos;re wearing .
are you acc@@ us@@ ing me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t drive now . you &apos;ve been drin@@ king .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t res@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s O@@ K .
fol@@ low your heart , for it never lies .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in Americ@@ a , wrote us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the contr@@ act is in the b@@ a@@ g , so let &apos;s go out and cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate .
ac@@ c@@ or@@ ding to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have n@@ ine lives .
he was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to S@@ pain on ho@@ li@@ day .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether he should do that or not .
this broken v@@ a@@ se cannot be re@@ p@@ ai@@ red .
we must have fai@@ th in the pres@@ ident .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to l@@ ess@@ en the im@@ p@@ act of the er@@ r@@ ati@@ c sup@@ p@@ lies .
he has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
do whatever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
we cannot ru@@ le out the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that ci@@ v@@ il w@@ ar will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl an@@ sw@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w sal@@ ad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; should I m@@ ea@@ sure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; you can e@@ y@@ e@@ b@@ all it if you want . &quot;
si@@ g@@ n this .
whose book is this ?
he d@@ anced like a lea@@ f in the au@@ tu@@ m@@ n w@@ in@@ d .
you must be c@@ au@@ ti@@ ous .
she promis@@ ed to meet him at the coffee sho@@ p .
he &apos;s very poli@@ te .
pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets may oper@@ ate in this ar@@ e@@ a .
this hat is too small . please show me another one .
they forgot to lo@@ ck the door .
speaking English isn &apos;t easy , but interesting .
we need to remember that .
we must talk her out of this fo@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ h plan .
yes , as far as I know .
I was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing .
it &apos;s cold outside .
please be@@ at the eg@@ gs .
I know it &apos;s un@@ re@@ al@@ is@@ tic to exp@@ ect Tom to do that .
a wh@@ ale is a m@@ am@@ m@@ al .
I wrote down his phone number on a s@@ cr@@ ap of paper .
I hope it &apos;s not just a cu@@ ri@@ o@@ s@@ ity .
I can &apos;t im@@ ag@@ ine my life without Tom .
in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by her tea@@ ch@@ ers , P@@ har@@ am@@ p is going to start her sol@@ ar car@@ e@@ er tomorrow .
I lost the b@@ et .

Tom is standing over there near the fi@@ re@@ place .
do you mind if I turn down the TV ?
I tried that .
Tom went to my room .
why are you busy today ?
when he r@@ an into di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ties , he asked his parents for help .

can you tell me what this word me@@ ans ?
I think they want you to do it .
I read ang@@ er in her face .
how many cl@@ as@@ s@@ es do you have on Mon@@ days ?
it b@@ le@@ w my mind .
it &apos;s the d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic inter@@ ac@@ tion between the char@@ ac@@ ters that makes this no@@ v@@ el so great .
we have to make sure that we never do this again .
I like the m@@ el@@ o@@ d@@ y of this s@@ ong .

he has big problems .
H@@ ar@@ b@@ in is very cold .
I caught a cold two days ago .
I &apos;m here not because of that .
she doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bi@@ ke .
it would be a good idea to try doing that .
did we miss anything ?
I couldn &apos;t do this without your help .
Tom is a n@@ at@@ ur@@ al ath@@ le@@ te .
I guess I &apos;ve go@@ tt@@ en l@@ az@@ y .
what do you re@@ gre@@ t most ?
Tom knew there was something in the box , but he didn &apos;t know what .
I &apos;m in char@@ ge here .

come near the fire .
do you mind if I watch TV for a while ?
he can b@@ end an ir@@ on ro@@ d with his hands .
you &apos;re not al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed to leave this room .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his dog .
he &apos;s promis@@ ing us nothing .
I re@@ comm@@ end it high@@ ly .

he is away from home .
I appreciate anything you can do .

I called him to the tel@@ e@@ phone .
few people can realize their f@@ au@@ l@@ ts .
bir@@ ds have sh@@ ar@@ p vis@@ i@@ on .
who is Tom ?
Mary took the co@@ ok@@ ies out of the o@@ v@@ en .
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
he is something of a cel@@ e@@ bri@@ ty .
life is a m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y to be lived , not a problem to be sol@@ ved .
I won &apos;t be able to stop .
I don &apos;t know the the@@ at@@ er play , but I know the au@@ th@@ or well .

M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L lo@@ ad@@ s s@@ ever@@ al t@@ ab@@ les .
I must have gone past the station while I was taking a n@@ ap .
I forgot that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s best friend .
the dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y between the sto@@ ri@@ es of the two parti@@ es invol@@ ved in the accident was so great that the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties had a hard time dec@@ i@@ ding which si@@ de was telling the truth .
in case of rain , the ath@@ le@@ tic meeting will be called off .
there is a cat .
be careful !
I love your son .
where are your car keys ?
I think of you as a friend .
you have no need to be as@@ ham@@ ed .
A@@ le@@ j@@ and@@ r@@ a wrote to her pen p@@ al in I@@ tal@@ y .
his ni@@ e@@ ce is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive and mat@@ ure for her age .
you do like living d@@ ang@@ er@@ ously .
s@@ pr@@ ing has re@@ turned . the Earth is like a child that knows po@@ em@@ s .
what did I do wrong ?
W@@ i@@ p@@ e your tears .
it took me more than two hours to trans@@ late a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to con@@ c@@ en@@ tr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not cre@@ ative .
the books were so v@@ al@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the gre@@ at@@ est care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong tree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t start all this .
I wish you could have come with me .
as a matter of fact , all great dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ers have been re@@ gar@@ ded as dre@@ am@@ ers .
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I promise that you won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed .
can you drive man@@ u@@ al ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I m@@ ess@@ ed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a ch@@ ain s@@ mo@@ k@@ er .
P@@ e@@ as@@ ants often have a se@@ con@@ d@@ ary ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity to au@@ g@@ ment their in@@ come .
our pass@@ por@@ ts were c@@ an@@ cel@@ led .
me@@ dic@@ ine should be out of the way of children .
that word des@@ cri@@ b@@ es it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
he works for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ key ?
why are you so clu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?
help me .
don &apos;t stay here .
the neigh@@ bo@@ r &apos;s dog is always bar@@ king .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ t@@ ai@@ l party .
Tom has ag@@ re@@ ed to help us .
I &apos;m sup@@ er hungry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those problems .
it &apos;s my f@@ au@@ l@@ t !
if the situation doesn &apos;t im@@ pro@@ ve , I &apos;ll be o@@ b@@ li@@ g@@ ed to take m@@ ea@@ su@@ r@@ es .
I have an u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a in my car .
whose shoes are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ ef .
do you know where he went ?
the b@@ ear is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ case to your room , si@@ r .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door needs another coat of pain@@ t .
I told you so !
he always went f@@ is@@ hing on the river when he was young .
he has three s@@ ons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ pro@@ ve your Spanish , you shouldn &apos;t have come to C@@ hi@@ le .
I know you like to tr@@ av@@ el .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the m@@ oun@@ t@@ ains and to the sea .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he av@@ eng@@ ed the mu@@ r@@ der of his father .
my watch lo@@ ses ten minutes a day .
he is completely b@@ es@@ o@@ t@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air con@@ di@@ ti@@ on@@ ed house .
I was f@@ al@@ sel@@ y acc@@ used .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ pr@@ ess himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a h@@ ea@@ d@@ a@@ ch@@ e , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ head of s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
Tom r@@ ar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ k@@ er .
when we look at other pl@@ ac@@ es in the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se , it could very well be that p@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exc@@ ep@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be e@@ as@@ i@@ er for students if there were only one sin@@ g@@ le Spanish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the case .
I won &apos;t run away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice ser@@ i@@ ously .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday afternoon .
I haven &apos;t told the kids yet that we &apos;re getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
let me car@@ ry it for you .
I prefer to write in French .
he fai@@ led the en@@ tr@@ ance ex@@ am .
someone was here .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a sho@@ wer now .
the house clo@@ s@@ est to here is two m@@ il@@ es away .
her age qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ es her for the job .
he ac@@ ted like a l@@ un@@ ati@@ c .
they can &apos;t do that .
are you list@@ en@@ ing ?
I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ri@@ s@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
if I &apos;d only taken your advice !
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
Sami thinks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my pl@@ ea@@ su@@ r@@ es is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .
were there any stars in the sk@@ y ?
Tom a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is g@@ ro@@ wing th@@ ic@@ k@@ er .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
I &apos;m a lucky man .
E@@ ar@@ ning our cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence and res@@ p@@ ect is this f@@ ir@@ m &apos;s ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tive .
what will the neigh@@ b@@ ors think ?
you can &apos;t pro@@ ve a thing .
this school sup@@ p@@ lies students with t@@ ex@@ t@@ books .
his del@@ ay of coming here on time is du@@ e to a tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
Japan has a lot of tr@@ ade with C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
sh@@ u@@ t the window to pre@@ v@@ ent c@@ at@@ ching a cold .
it &apos;s dangerous here .
Tom took a day off .
the D@@ ea@@ d S@@ e@@ a lies b@@ el@@ o@@ w sea l@@ ev@@ el .
Mary &apos;s favorite movie is T@@ he P@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ ess B@@ ride .
the situation is under con@@ tro@@ l .
I miss you already .
when did you become a teacher ?
they are my friends .
you might as well go kill yourself .
we play a s@@ port .
he isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I &apos;m just looking out for myself .
he l@@ ac@@ ks t@@ act .
we were con@@ c@@ er@@ ned .
A@@ ch@@ i@@ ev@@ ing a nice w@@ el@@ d b@@ ea@@ d is not wi@@ th@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
it was not a compl@@ e@@ te vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory .
we el@@ ected Tom cap@@ t@@ ain of the team .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
fun@@ ny !
I can &apos;t do that .
she hand@@ ed me a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
I just have to do something .
nobody in@@ su@@ l@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was fav@@ or@@ able .
how many col@@ ou@@ r@@ s are there ?
the language of fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p is not words but me@@ an@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .
I sp@@ ent a week with a P@@ al@@ es@@ t@@ in@@ i@@ an family from G@@ az@@ a .
we &apos;re working to fi@@ x this bu@@ g .
let me con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate you on your en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement .
a t@@ sun@@ am@@ i is coming , so please be on the al@@ er@@ t .
why did you tell him that ?
Tom was aw@@ fu@@ l@@ ly bo@@ red .
the n@@ u@@ l@@ l h@@ y@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is st@@ ates how often a s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing er@@ ro@@ r alone will pro@@ du@@ ce res@@ ul@@ ts that are different than a fo@@ rec@@ as@@ t .
at the party there was food in ab@@ un@@ dance .
I want you to speak f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly .
they are seeing their un@@ c@@ le tomorrow .
I &apos;m on the inter@@ st@@ ate .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I fi@@ gu@@ red I might find you here .
Tom r@@ us@@ hed past me .
news of her death c@@ au@@ s@@ ed great con@@ c@@ er@@ n th@@ r@@ ou@@ gh@@ out the country .
Tom is b@@ it@@ ing his n@@ ails .
how many of you are there now ?
I &apos;m s@@ mar@@ ter than you .
you &apos;re very nice .
I couldn &apos;t en@@ ter because the door was closed .
the new t@@ un@@ ne@@ l will l@@ in@@ k B@@ ri@@ t@@ ain and France .
in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of going to school , he stayed at home .
I wish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed .
I must br@@ ush up my English .
it is in the restaurant where Dan e@@ ats lunch .
they g@@ ang@@ ed up on him .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happen@@ ing .
Tom ru@@ m@@ m@@ ag@@ ed through the dr@@ aw@@ er , looking for a pen@@ c@@ il .
do you need a ride home later ?
I took the little girl by the hand .
my father sp@@ ends a lot of time on his ho@@ b@@ by .
you che@@ ated .
do you know how to play the piano ?
I wanted to make sure you were all right .
you &apos;ve found it .
I don &apos;t understand your res@@ i@@ st@@ ance .
Mon@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
the weather today is wor@@ se than yesterday .
I plan to have lunch with him .
she is wat@@ er@@ ing the flowers .
I think Tom e@@ ats too much me@@ at .
what di@@ rec@@ tion are you going ?
I wish there were a French trans@@ l@@ ation of this book .
down came the rain in t@@ or@@ r@@ en@@ ts .
she tried to com@@ for@@ t him , but he kept crying .
that won &apos;t change anything .
the most was@@ ted day of all is that on which we have not laugh@@ ed .
the way tou@@ ri@@ sts dress off@@ ends lo@@ cal st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of pro@@ pri@@ ety .
we can &apos;t give up .
it &apos;s a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ standing .
they want someone to help them .
I &apos;m too tired to ar@@ gu@@ e .
that lies outside my ar@@ e@@ a of study .
my un@@ c@@ le has a house in I@@ tal@@ y .
she turned down my off@@ er .
Tom has three boys and a girl .
my bo@@ y@@ friend looks like your girlfriend .
Tom was in the sho@@ wer .
we &apos;ll meet at my house .
you &apos;re the teacher .
we &apos;ve lost fai@@ th in hu@@ man@@ ity .
you must &apos;ve thought I was an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
did he forget his money again ?
look out for ro@@ ck sli@@ d@@ es .
the boy caught a large fish .
don &apos;t forget to pos@@ t the letter .
the plan@@ e accident cost the lives of 2@@ 00 people .
I have lived in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o since 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 5 .
she was a bri@@ des@@ m@@ aid at the we@@ d@@ ding .
how do I know that you &apos;re not going to do that again ?
she goes out almost every night .
she &apos;s very tal@@ ent@@ ed .
come wh@@ en@@ ever it is con@@ v@@ en@@ i@@ ent to you .
the s@@ c@@ and@@ al was f@@ at@@ al to his poli@@ ti@@ cal future .
it &apos;s not easy to understand his i@@ de@@ as .
please accep@@ t my sin@@ c@@ er@@ est con@@ do@@ l@@ ences .

rest here for a bit .
I had never seen a more beautiful si@@ ght .
a b@@ y@@ st@@ and@@ er vi@@ de@@ o@@ t@@ ap@@ ed the police be@@ ating using their c@@ ell phone .
I had trouble fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep last night .
Tom &apos;s grand@@ father knew my grand@@ father .
she w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ led her bro@@ ws .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately he re@@ f@@ used to come .
am I on the wrong ro@@ ad ?
the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake sm@@ as@@ hed everything .
I speak H@@ un@@ gar@@ i@@ an .
I s@@ pr@@ ang out of bed .
those are your op@@ tions .
I knew that was Tom .
Tom has lived here since 20@@ 0@@ 3 .
I am coun@@ ting on you to d@@ el@@ i@@ ver the o@@ pen@@ ing address .
she walked s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly for f@@ ear she should sli@@ p .
stop f@@ il@@ m@@ ing .
you &apos;re one of my best friends .
do it this way .
if you &apos;re not happy with the money , give it to me . I will be happy .
they were sol@@ di@@ ers .
bro@@ wn is not her n@@ at@@ ur@@ al hair co@@ lo@@ r .
hasn &apos;t Tom arrived yet ?
when are you going to get married ?
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
Tom bl@@ us@@ hed back .
Tom thinks Mary is u@@ g@@ ly .
they ar@@ gu@@ e a lot .
n@@ one of you should leave this room .
Tom works in ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
a woman &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th is in her t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
clothes are behind me .
some of the p@@ ho@@ to@@ s have been taken at the ri@@ s@@ k of life .
that box is heavy .
where were you born ?
it was very different from what I had im@@ ag@@ in@@ ed .
do you have everything ?
the reason is clear .
he said the truth .
a man of sense would be as@@ ham@@ ed to do so .
he is not too poor to buy a bicycle .
Tom can &apos;t help .
you &apos;re lo@@ sing .
it is best that we speak with a spec@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ t .
the 2@@ 6@@ th of S@@ ep@@ t@@ em@@ b@@ er is the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an D@@ ay of L@@ ang@@ u@@ ages . the C@@ oun@@ c@@ il of E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e wants to dr@@ a@@ w attention to the mu@@ l@@ ti@@ l@@ in@@ gu@@ al her@@ it@@ age of E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e , to fo@@ st@@ er the ev@@ o@@ lu@@ tion of mu@@ l@@ ti@@ l@@ in@@ gu@@ al@@ is@@ m in so@@ ci@@ ety and to en@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ age ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to learn languages โ โ .

the next day , at sup@@ per@@ time , I was in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced to her husband .

how many people are there in your family ?
someone turned the al@@ ar@@ m off .
do you believe that there &apos;s life after death ?
I had a promise to keep .
aren &apos;t you hungry ?
mine is not so good as yours .
let &apos;s eat a wat@@ er@@ m@@ el@@ on !
please tell me how you plan to do that .
the strange ob@@ j@@ ect in the sk@@ y could be seen with the un@@ ai@@ ded eye .
Tom is cl@@ au@@ s@@ tr@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ c .
our anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors came to this country 1@@ 5@@ 0 years ago .
I have never sun@@ g , and never will sing , in a k@@ ar@@ a@@ o@@ ke b@@ ar .
the gen@@ i@@ e is out of the bo@@ tt@@ le .
H@@ on@@ es@@ tly , Tom , I can &apos;t remember . it was more than 1@@ 0 years ago .
who is born to be h@@ ang@@ ed will never be dro@@ w@@ ned .
how do you know I &apos;m not the one who did it ?
he wouldn &apos;t even look at me .

I &apos;m thir@@ ty .
comm@@ un@@ is@@ m will never be re@@ ach@@ ed in my li@@ fe@@ time .
the sun will become a red gi@@ ant in about 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on years .
I fi@@ gu@@ red it out by myself .
there is a world of differ@@ ence between , &quot; s@@ om@@ e@@ how being un@@ der@@ sto@@ od &quot; and &quot; using correct English . &quot;
I as@@ su@@ me that &apos;s a jo@@ ke .
E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans drink , on av@@ er@@ age , 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 li@@ ters of pu@@ re al@@ co@@ ho@@ l per year .

I &apos;m star@@ ting to get used to the food here .
I &apos;m not going to for@@ ce you to do that .
he id@@ les away his time .
it didn &apos;t not work .
there is an old c@@ as@@ t@@ le at the fo@@ o@@ t of the mountain .
you told me that you were tired .
if the spec@@ t@@ at@@ ors made fun of the other team , then it would wea@@ ken their m@@ or@@ ale .
I &apos;m pr@@ ess@@ ing char@@ g@@ es .
he succ@@ ee@@ ded in the exam@@ in@@ ation at his first at@@ t@@ em@@ p@@ t .
when the cur@@ t@@ ain went up , the st@@ age was dark .
I am un@@ com@@ for@@ table in these new shoes .
we must pay attention to the tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic light .
he did all the le@@ g@@ work .
don &apos;t leave the bicycle in the rain .
I like milk .
the river f@@ lo@@ ws down to the sea .
you tell him the truth .
the old pro@@ f@@ es@@ so@@ r &apos;s l@@ ec@@ tures are long @-@ win@@ ded and pon@@ der@@ ous .
I &apos;m lucky to have a job .
you &apos;ve really turned black now .
have you tried it ?
what time do you get up every day ?
we will im@@ pl@@ ement a re@@ consi@@ dered N@@ or@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th co@@ oper@@ ation me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to spend her summer v@@ ac@@ ation .
I didn &apos;t realize you were aw@@ ake .
sh@@ u@@ t up , you &apos;re dis@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting me .
you don &apos;t live in a country ; you live in a language . your hom@@ el@@ and , that &apos;s that and nothing else .
I will wait here until he comes back .
why aren &apos;t you studying ?
I can &apos;t make it to your party next w@@ ee@@ k@@ end .
where &apos;s everybody else ?
the lo@@ a@@ f is small .
we try to ex@@ plain things ac@@ ro@@ ss cul@@ tures ; in sp@@ ite of b@@ oun@@ d@@ ar@@ ies .
they bur@@ ned .
I &apos;ve lost my reli@@ gi@@ ous fai@@ th .
did you talk about me ?
you must not go out at night .
all I want is your cat .
we began on a new pro@@ ject .
I have to leave on Mon@@ day .
I want to be more than friends .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ t@@ act you .
your com@@ ic books are on the sh@@ el@@ f .
a s@@ a@@ di@@ st is always at the same time a m@@ as@@ o@@ ch@@ ist .
I &apos;m just not very hungry .
I &apos;ve given this quite a lot of thought .
call an am@@ bu@@ l@@ ance .
she said that she had to be back before d@@ a@@ wn .
I thought you were in@@ ju@@ red .
I want to see more .
she d@@ anced with jo@@ y .
why are you st@@ a@@ y@@ ing ?
how are you going to get home ?
do you think I look like my brother ?
I just couldn &apos;t help myself .
cl@@ ou@@ ds bl@@ ac@@ ken the sk@@ y ( and everyone &apos;s mo@@ od ) .
could you please sh@@ ar@@ pen these kni@@ ves ?
my father might be at home now .
the man was no better than a h@@ or@@ se .
you spend too much time with her .
I have no fun@@ ds in the b@@ ank .
that &apos;s kind of v@@ ag@@ u@@ e .
you started crying .
I feel bad for them .
I thought you wanted a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce .
there &apos;s no need for you to pre@@ p@@ are a for@@ m@@ al s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h .
you are ho@@ p@@ el@@ ess !
where did you go to school ?
I also like you .
we &apos;ve just c@@ le@@ an@@ ed the to@@ il@@ ets .
I &apos;m tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing light .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
they hun@@ g their co@@ ats behind the door .
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ op@@ her C@@ o@@ lu@@ m@@ bus once cut himself with a kni@@ f@@ e . it made him so angry that he then cut the kni@@ f@@ e ... with himself .
did anyone see you on the b@@ each ?
everyone did it .
it is im@@ possible for him to do it .
she used to wash her hair before going to school .
I &apos;ve already seen the f@@ il@@ m .
she kept her eyes closed .
you &apos;re not al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed in here .
Tom no@@ d@@ ded quickly .
I need money in gener@@ al , not just now .
we didn &apos;t see her an@@ y@@ where .
this is for you .
at last , the end @-@ of @-@ ter@@ m exam@@ s are over .
it is not given to everybody to study ab@@ ro@@ ad .
I really hope you &apos;re right .
we have to res@@ p@@ ect lo@@ cal cu@@ st@@ om@@ s .
I &apos;m quite happy .
Tom &apos;s l@@ ap@@ top has a tou@@ ch@@ p@@ ad .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t put it into words .
have you seen my keys ?
Tom only drin@@ ks water .
where do you get off telling me that ?
get fu@@ cked in the ass !
children are f@@ on@@ d of cake .
you really do have a beautiful vo@@ i@@ ce .
I &apos;ll never for@@ give you .
that &apos;s very good .
he hur@@ ried so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
you &apos;re not thinking c@@ le@@ ar@@ ly .
he is far from being hon@@ est .
have you ever sh@@ a@@ ken with cold ?
I &apos;m glad you called .
we &apos;re doing all we can .
how about having a bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e party next Sun@@ day ?
you &apos;re d@@ ou@@ ble @-@ par@@ ked .
or@@ ang@@ es are sw@@ e@@ et@@ er than l@@ em@@ ons .
it &apos;s not necessary to write more than 4@@ 00 words .
she gave me her phone number .
sel@@ ling car@@ s is my job .
ten years is a long time to wait .
it &apos;s re@@ d@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
it is going to rain soon .
how do I tell my parents that I &apos;m pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant ?
Tom didn &apos;t pay me as much as he promis@@ ed he would .
tell them who you are .
he has a nice body .
I re@@ c@@ or@@ ded you sin@@ ging .
we used to live in K@@ o@@ be .
you may as well get used to it .
I will wait for a week .
this morning I got up ear@@ li@@ er than u@@ su@@ al .
I stayed at a nice hotel .
do black ho@@ les exist ?
how come your Spanish is that good ?
I &apos;m not sel@@ fish .
it is too early to go to bed .
good h@@ ab@@ its should be cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ated in ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood .
it &apos;s getting late . I don &apos;t w@@ an@@ n@@ a go home alone .
your pro@@ fi@@ le p@@ ho@@ to is un@@ pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al .
win@@ ter does not look real without snow .
tell me what Tom took with him .
I want the truth from you .
call me after you talk to Tom .
S@@ y@@ d@@ ne@@ y is far from here .
I want you to go to the pos@@ t office .
he gave in his pro@@ ject late .
I think Tom is still sleeping .
he was bur@@ st@@ ing with fu@@ ry .
n@@ er@@ v@@ ous ? me ? no !
you said there was an em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
you really lu@@ cked out on this one .
I take a v@@ ac@@ ation this week .
I have work to do .
you won &apos;t find a dog bi@@ g@@ ger than this one .
I met her at a dinner party .
W@@ ho@@ ever wants it may take it .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
you &apos;re just a co@@ ward .
pain@@ ting is another thing I can do fai@@ r@@ ly well .
D@@ is@@ ti@@ ll@@ ed water has no t@@ as@@ te .
there are two cats sleeping on the bed .
you have to promise not to tell anyone .
I am interested in music .
it &apos;s a was@@ te of time and money .
I &apos;ll try to get a l@@ ay of the land before I start con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting .
I was having breakfast when I saw the fire in the gar@@ d@@ en .
every time I join a new game of W@@ ar@@ cr@@ a@@ f@@ t , I am p@@ itted against a new team of ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ar@@ ies .
I liked them before they became po@@ pu@@ l@@ ar .
this dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary is of great v@@ al@@ u@@ e to us .
a st@@ ar sh@@ ines on the hour of our meeting .
here we took the bo@@ at for Al@@ as@@ k@@ a .
she has a son and two d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters .
I didn &apos;t want to do this in the first place .
I have always felt that you always knew that Sami was your son .
we all have arrived .
I &apos;m on cr@@ u@@ t@@ ches for the next month .
I cannot stop the b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
he is always trying to do the im@@ possible .
don &apos;t comp@@ lic@@ ate the problem by r@@ ai@@ s@@ ing new is@@ su@@ es .
Un@@ believ@@ able !
&quot; the e@@ con@@ om@@ y has opened up a f@@ au@@ l@@ t@@ line in the A@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ tic , &quot; an@@ n@@ oun@@ ces L@@ a S@@ t@@ am@@ p@@ a , re@@ por@@ ting on the im@@ p@@ act of rec@@ ent re@@ mar@@ ks by B@@ ar@@ ack O@@ b@@ am@@ a which im@@ pl@@ y that the poor man@@ ag@@ ement of the E@@ u@@ ro@@ z@@ one cri@@ s@@ is is to bl@@ ame for the fe@@ e@@ ble ou@@ t@@ look for g@@ ro@@ w@@ th in the U@@ S .
I have to hurry !
women today drink as much as men .
they had once hel@@ ped each other .
the pri@@ ce of go@@ ld flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ates d@@ ai@@ ly .
he is nothing but a po@@ et .
that can happen .
I &apos;ve decided to do the same thing .
he d@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ed his own theory .
how are you doing ? I haven &apos;t seen you in ages !
I bo@@ o@@ k@@ mar@@ ked this we@@ b@@ si@@ te .
why is she so po@@ pu@@ l@@ ar ?
did you kill Tom ?
she &apos;s not a vi@@ r@@ g@@ in anymore .
you li@@ ed to me , didn &apos;t you ?
tell me again where you live .
is that correct ?
she decided to marry him .
she &apos;s learning to swim .
I can &apos;t come and see you every day .
I &apos;ll close the door .
the women play tennis .
which came first , the ch@@ ic@@ ken or the eg@@ g ?
she pass@@ ed away yesterday afternoon .
I &apos;m going to take care of it for you .
now go have fun .
he married my c@@ ou@@ s@@ in .
I &apos;m really f@@ ed up with this h@@ e@@ at .
Tom went to sleep three hours ago .
she was talking all the time .
there are s@@ even days in a week .
what &apos;s that t@@ all building ?
are those your d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters ?
I don &apos;t want to miss my train .
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
we don &apos;t know what they want to use it for .
eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers try to take adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of n@@ at@@ ure rather than try to understand it .
do you work here ?
I saw land in the dist@@ ance .
that &apos;s a good guess .
the pri@@ s@@ on@@ er es@@ cap@@ ed under co@@ ver of night .
could you , please , l@@ end me your car tomorrow ?
they &apos;re right behind you .
we pres@@ ent@@ ed a watch to him .
I want to live in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I think Tom is c@@ ou@@ r@@ ag@@ e@@ ous .
he hi@@ d@@ es his head in the s@@ and , like an o@@ st@@ rich .
I don &apos;t think I have the experience necessary for that job .
she got a present from her bo@@ y@@ friend .
can you turn off the light ?
Mr W@@ hi@@ te made a few comm@@ ents on my s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h .
he is n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ered am@@ ong the gre@@ at@@ est s@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts in the world .
could you try to be a little less sel@@ fish for a change ?
you won &apos;t be shot .
he has money .
we had lunch ear@@ li@@ er than u@@ su@@ al and went out at tw@@ el@@ ve thir@@ ty .
they were pl@@ ain@@ ly d@@ res@@ sed .
it &apos;s yours if you want it .
I think it &apos;s dangerous to c@@ li@@ m@@ b that mountain alone .
are you having dinner ?
why don &apos;t you believe them ?
b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its of c@@ ou@@ r@@ se should exc@@ e@@ ed the co@@ sts .
they were att@@ acked .
I pro@@ test !
is anybody in there ?
the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant is being acc@@ used of a li@@ t@@ any of cri@@ min@@ al and ci@@ v@@ il off@@ en@@ ses .
I thought Tom had ag@@ re@@ ed to do the job .
what should I eat ?
it &apos;s in the fri@@ dge .
he &apos;s not going to visit you tomorrow .
he may not be able to come .
the doctor se@@ i@@ zed the p@@ ati@@ ent &apos;s hand and said : &quot; so how do we feel today ? &quot;
where are you from ?
you &apos;ve never seen a gen@@ u@@ ine di@@ am@@ on@@ d .
she came into the room .
she fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed me into the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en and pic@@ ked up a kni@@ f@@ e .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
he is pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed with his work .
it began to rain before I got home .
there are more B@@ u@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts in G@@ er@@ many today than people who know how to make a good cho@@ co@@ late cake .
I didn &apos;t res@@ ist the pres@@ sure they for@@ ced on me .
why is in@@ sur@@ ance so important ?
put your p@@ ants on .
how about stop@@ ping the car and taking a rest ?
I have to go to the sal@@ on and get my ro@@ o@@ t tou@@ ched up .
I rec@@ ei@@ ved an in@@ v@@ it@@ ation .
I knew you &apos;d come back to me .
you make my day so much bri@@ gh@@ ter .
do you think Tom is gu@@ il@@ ty ?
they found out .
I know who I &apos;d re@@ comm@@ end for the job .
I miss Tom .
wash your fe@@ et .
they want more sp@@ a@@ ce .
he was ready to face his f@@ ate .
why don &apos;t you put some clothes on ?
I just hope it &apos;s not too late .
sit at the table .
L@@ on@@ don is large , com@@ par@@ ed with Paris .
I &apos;m going out .
what do you in@@ t@@ en@@ d to do with the money ?
they made fun of my clothes .
I &apos;d like to get married .
smoking is har@@ m@@ ful to health .
would you please show me where the B@@ an@@ qu@@ e de France is lo@@ c@@ ated ?
is there a drink min@@ im@@ u@@ m ?
I have an un@@ c@@ le who lives in Boston .
we do all s@@ or@@ ts of things .
the Earth is a sp@@ here .
I like mat@@ h best .
yesterday , I found a t@@ in@@ y pi@@ e@@ ce of land for s@@ a@@ le in a qu@@ i@@ et res@@ id@@ enti@@ al ar@@ e@@ a and I immediately decided to buy it .
he at least a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ zed .
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced Mary to his family .
don &apos;t s@@ mi@@ le .
can you clean your be@@ d@@ room ?
the students like it .
g@@ lo@@ b@@ al war@@ m@@ ing will change the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s of the weather world @-@ wi@@ de .
what else do you know ?
they sh@@ are their same b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ s .
why didn &apos;t N@@ o@@ a@@ h sw@@ at those two mo@@ s@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ es ?
I didn &apos;t catch what he said .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary lives .
Tom bought an expensive Christmas present for himself .
he almost never went there .
what did you want to show us ?
don &apos;t try to be a her@@ o .
in his face !
I &apos;m one of you .
I don &apos;t want to be any more bur@@ d@@ en to my parents .
are you out of your mind ?
I &apos;m inside .
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
the only thing that mat@@ ters is that you weren &apos;t in@@ ju@@ red .
his be@@ h@@ av@@ i@@ or is very o@@ d@@ d today .
milk does not keep long in hot weather .
I like c@@ as@@ t@@ les .
a to@@ o@@ th@@ a@@ ch@@ e de@@ pri@@ ved me of sleep .
I &apos;ve decided .
I am free this evening .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand the ru@@ les .
I wanted to thank you for what you did today .
r@@ ab@@ b@@ its are rel@@ ated to be@@ av@@ ers and squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s .
we broke up .
you &apos;re very good .
s@@ av@@ e up so that you can go to col@@ le@@ ge .
if Tom and Mary are going to the z@@ o@@ o with you , I &apos;ll go , too .
he told me his life &apos;s story .
Tom has just finished eating dinner .
I need to know everything that you know about Tom .
not all tea@@ ch@@ ers be@@ have like that .
I think it will be sun@@ ny tomorrow .
yes , I think you ought to go .
go to bed !
I &apos;ve got a fl@@ as@@ h@@ light in the g@@ love com@@ par@@ t@@ ment .
yes , my child .
he ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed the poli@@ ti@@ cal b@@ ack@@ gr@@ ound of the w@@ ar on TV .
we played ch@@ ess .
Sami decided to turn a bl@@ in@@ d eye to the truth .
Tom had a difficult job .
that has nothing to do with it .
would you like to try it again ?
life is too short , really !
he fai@@ led to come yesterday .
Tom wants to be a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
he went there , never to re@@ turn .
I con@@ f@@ is@@ c@@ ated it .
I don &apos;t want to tell him .
what kind of mist@@ akes did you make ?
I wasn &apos;t the one dri@@ ving the car .
Tom p@@ at@@ ted me on the back and con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated me .
P@@ et@@ er was an al@@ tru@@ is@@ tic vi@@ de@@ o game play@@ er ; he would give it@@ em@@ s to people who needed them , rather than sel@@ ling them for per@@ s@@ on@@ al pro@@ f@@ it .
that cat is bro@@ wn .
it &apos;s not poli@@ te to st@@ are at others .
she went with him to the z@@ o@@ o .
he was s@@ col@@ ded by his teacher for being l@@ az@@ y .
I know that it is high@@ ly un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that we &apos;ll see any wh@@ al@@ es today .
if I have any more questions , where can I find you ?
it is about time you married .
the milk &apos;s a bit off .
my husband is in j@@ ai@@ l .
if I knew his address , I would get in touch with him right away .
Tom found something .
I had an u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a with me but my friend did not .
I can &apos;t fi@@ x the se@@ at .
he ig@@ no@@ red her advice .
there was something off in Sami &apos;s life .
you will be p@@ aid ac@@ c@@ or@@ ding to your ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty .
do you have much snow in your country ?
you look a little gre@@ en around the g@@ ill@@ s .
the doctor has no office hours on Mon@@ day morning .
he is not in .
we have a break from 1@@ 0 : 4@@ 0 to 1@@ 1 : 00 .
I &apos;m leaving in ten minutes .
I de@@ e@@ pl@@ y appreciate your advice and kin@@ d@@ ness .
I heard someone sh@@ ou@@ ting .
he only works du@@ ring the day .
Mary said that she &apos;d be late .
make up your mind already ! whether you go in or go out , just stop o@@ pen@@ ing this door !
you won &apos;t es@@ cap@@ e me .
he is flu@@ ent in Ch@@ in@@ ese .
I was exp@@ ec@@ ting you at 1@@ 1 : 00 a@@ .@@ m .
give me a ring if you find out anything .
having been busy all day yesterday , I feel very tired this morning .
what do you think they &apos;ll do ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for class on the first day .
sentences past this I@@ D are sentences ad@@ ded by con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ ors of Tatoeba P@@ ro@@ ject .
he will soon be able to swim well .
when he asked who had broken the window , all the boys put on an air of in@@ no@@ c@@ ence .
did you miss me ?
that &apos;s the har@@ d@@ est part .
I don &apos;t know for c@@ er@@ t@@ ain .
what time do you turn off the li@@ ghts ?
I have to say I en@@ v@@ y you .
his tr@@ ou@@ b@@ les are not over .
I &apos;m not sure what it was , but it s@@ oun@@ ded like a g@@ un@@ shot .
we have a d@@ ea@@ d@@ line .
is there s@@ om@@ e@@ where in E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e you &apos;d like to visit ?
he &apos;s a bi@@ got .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
he saw in her eyes that she still loved him and hope ar@@ o@@ se inside him .
I don &apos;t even know how old Tom is .
I s@@ lic@@ ed the s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h di@@ ag@@ on@@ ally .
she should have kept her m@@ ou@@ th sh@@ u@@ t .
I think love does not exist .
I guess my lu@@ ck just r@@ an out .
he plays bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball best of us all .
the dec@@ is@@ i@@ on is still not de@@ fin@@ ite .
it seems she is over thir@@ ty years old .
is your father a doctor ?
I &apos;ve asked you re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly to do that .
the music c@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed me back to my ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood .
for dinner , we went back to my place .
I had to go back .
nobody sup@@ por@@ ted my country .
I &apos;ll tell her where I went .
I just did it .
who are you sel@@ ling your car to ?
she speaks English as if she were a n@@ ative sp@@ ea@@ k@@ er .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
I don &apos;t like both of you going to such a place .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to live .
I &apos;m not happy with my looks .
I had to work over@@ time yesterday .
it &apos;ll be us three : you , me , and An@@ n@@ e .
they acc@@ used him of telling a lie .
I &apos;m sorry if I s@@ n@@ app@@ ed at you .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
last week five students were ab@@ s@@ ent from class .
Sami sp@@ illed his drink in the store .
you don &apos;t have what it takes to be a lea@@ der .
I don &apos;t like feeling so po@@ w@@ er@@ less .
nothing makes Tom happy .
Tom was late for dinner .
I am glad that the matter was s@@ et@@ t@@ led am@@ ic@@ ab@@ ly .
you &apos;re s@@ lo@@ sh@@ ed .
do you have anything to say to us ?
we pass@@ ed by the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ y before coming home .
I &apos;ll see you tomorrow at the library .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .

so , why are you here ?
&quot; this is ch@@ ea@@ per than a new hat , &quot; S@@ us@@ an an@@ sw@@ ered .

close your eyes , please .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you that on the phone .
I eat fruit and drink water .
I didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
I started the fire .
in the store , they bought the n@@ ec@@ es@@ si@@ ties and the su@@ per@@ flu@@ ous .
let &apos;s keep an eye on this .
I b@@ et you &apos;re talking about Tom .
I &apos;m sure , in the dist@@ ant future , you won &apos;t be able to for@@ give yourself .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s the weather is fine .

his en@@ coun@@ ter with her is en@@ ri@@ ching his in@@ n@@ er life .

while I was swimming , I got a cr@@ am@@ p in my le@@ g .
I need not have wat@@ ered the flowers . just after I finished it started rain@@ ing .

my opinion is different from yours .
they &apos;ve re@@ ali@@ zed they should stop dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against g@@ ays .
the well d@@ el@@ i@@ ver@@ s a great deal of o@@ il .
I &apos;m on my way .
I remember seeing her .
who is that boy ?
he didn &apos;t have time to spend with his children .
what choice did I have ?
please don &apos;t l@@ au@@ g@@ h at me .

do not drink too much br@@ and@@ y !
don &apos;t talk to me about him .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
I didn &apos;t realize you could speak French .
where did you get that or@@ ang@@ e scar@@ f ?
the story turned my b@@ lo@@ od cold .
because there are a lot of vo@@ l@@ c@@ an@@ o@@ es , it is easy for Japan to be hit by ear@@ th@@ qu@@ akes .
I &apos;m looking for people to speak E@@ s@@ per@@ an@@ to with .
I just started crying .
this book is too expensive .
the bill , please .
sh@@ ame be to him who thinks ev@@ il of it .
if you &apos;re sick , hon@@ e@@ y t@@ as@@ t@@ es b@@ it@@ ter .

Tom dr@@ ank three bo@@ tt@@ les of wine by himself last night .
I wish there were some hot girls in my class .
the company didn &apos;t immediately respon@@ d to re@@ qu@@ es@@ ts for com@@ ment .
I enjoy swimming .
how do you say that in French ?
I &apos;d kill for a beer right now .
Tom was wearing a w@@ i@@ re .
who are you t@@ ex@@ ting ?
you shouldn &apos;t read in such poor light .
would you like to eat something ?
happy is the man who is con@@ t@@ ent with his lot .
that &apos;s why I asked .
the com@@ ic books were p@@ il@@ ed on the des@@ k .
I want to play .
I &apos;m sure Tom was invol@@ ved .
Tom has a lot of to@@ ys .
this is an old building .
do you believe in g@@ ho@@ sts ?
am I being acc@@ used of mu@@ r@@ der ?
I &apos;ve been very busy since the new ter@@ m started .
I &apos;m much ol@@ der than you are .
when did Tom ar@@ ri@@ ve ?
I can &apos;t wait to meet him .
that &apos;s n@@ on@@ sense . nobody but a fo@@ ol would believe it .
Tom is a good b@@ ass play@@ er .

I su@@ gg@@ est that you take a n@@ ap .
am I really the only one here who doesn &apos;t understand French ?
why does he have to do that ?
this is the man for you to speak to .
the student mis@@ sed class three times in a row .
if I had known about your ill@@ ness , I could have vis@@ ited you in the hospital .
give me a ring if you find out anything .
it &apos;s just not wor@@ th it .
why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
don &apos;t touch the flowers .

B@@ o@@ b re@@ ach@@ ed the finish line first .
I think we were lucky .

take my glasses .
I &apos;ve stop@@ ped p@@ a@@ y@@ ing attention to ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant , mat@@ er@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ tic and un@@ pl@@ e@@ as@@ ant people .

you &apos;re the teacher .
how much more su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing can they end@@ ure ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for work .
can you help me write a love letter ?
I haven &apos;t done this since high school .
something is wrong with this c@@ al@@ cul@@ at@@ or .
the story cannot be true .
did you understand what I me@@ ant by that ?
please th@@ row me the ball .
I do not like ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ c@@ s very much .
Americ@@ ans spend most of their lives working , being pro@@ du@@ c@@ tive .

the T@@ i@@ me T@@ r@@ av@@ el@@ l@@ er d@@ ev@@ o@@ ted his attention to his dinner , and dis@@ played the ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ te of a tr@@ am@@ p .
how did you come by this pain@@ ting ?
how much did they give you for your old car ?
he married a pretty girl .
I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to do that .
you only think about having fun .
I cannot make no@@ i@@ se . the baby is sleeping .
how do you deal with it ?
let &apos;s wait an hour .
I r@@ an into an old friend of mine at the party the other day .
I wonder what it could be .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I br@@ ought you another bl@@ an@@ k@@ et .
S@@ am is two years y@@ oun@@ ger than Tom .
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday .
you are in Boston .
that &apos;s not your problem anymore .
I know that you are busy .
you are a doctor .
will the train leave on time ?
I &apos;m w@@ ill@@ ing to help you if you want me to .
I don &apos;t know how to des@@ cri@@ be it .
Mary always y@@ el@@ ls when she &apos;s angry .
Tom tried to hu@@ l@@ a ho@@ o@@ p .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s you are mist@@ a@@ ken .
if the times go against you , then go with the times .
when I en@@ ter@@ ed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , she was making ch@@ ic@@ ken cur@@ ry with ri@@ ce .
I am through with my work .
who is the man s@@ it@@ ting in the c@@ or@@ n@@ er ?
my parents har@@ dly ever p@@ un@@ is@@ hed me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don shi@@ p .
the off@@ ici@@ al we dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed of his o@@ b@@ li@@ g@@ ations .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
his legs are long .
Mary was lucky to find her keys .
it began to snow .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a present for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may cho@@ o@@ se wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever you want .
I never talked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this con@@ c@@ er@@ t was aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
what is life without the ra@@ di@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ g@@ et@@ table place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ dis@@ pu@@ table fact that Americ@@ ans are , as Americ@@ ans , the most sel@@ f @-@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ dic@@ ted to the b@@ el@@ i@@ ef that the other n@@ ations of the ear@@ th are in a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ac@@ y to un@@ der@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ e them .
we &apos;re sun@@ k .
do not un@@ der@@ es@@ ti@@ m@@ ate my po@@ wer .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ cked up .
I b@@ et you &apos;re right .
have some coffee .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ du@@ c@@ ated people .
the w@@ ri@@ ter does not always present life as it is .
language and cul@@ ture can &apos;t be se@@ par@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a t@@ a@@ x@@ i st@@ and near the station .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ a@@ tr@@ a &apos;s no@@ se had been sh@@ or@@ ter , the history of the world would be different .
his room was small but clean , and the food was good .
his s@@ le@@ ev@@ e tou@@ ched the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
S@@ m@@ it@@ h has sp@@ ent years studying the e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts of sleep and sleep lo@@ ss on m@@ em@@ ory and learning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
the cat ru@@ in@@ ed my so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re less than h@@ al@@ f@@ way to the top of the mountain . are you already tired ?
con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations !
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar@@ ly feeling down in the du@@ m@@ ps .
they &apos;re all on v@@ ac@@ ation .
if you can , come with us .
I tr@@ us@@ t Tom &apos;s ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to become the man@@ ager .
a cro@@ w@@ d was g@@ ath@@ er@@ ing around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she died of tu@@ b@@ er@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is .
it was your mistake .
it was very ru@@ de of you to say a thing like that .
these t@@ ex@@ ts were written in H@@ e@@ bre@@ w , not in A@@ r@@ am@@ ai@@ c .
you look f@@ am@@ i@@ li@@ ar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a t@@ our of Americ@@ a , stop@@ ping in six ci@@ ties .
M@@ r@@ . Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ is@@ h@@ es his son would study har@@ der .
I have no f@@ au@@ l@@ ts .
please si@@ g@@ n here .
I need a little help here .
you &apos;re going to have to pay for the re@@ p@@ air .
take things as they are .
it is rain@@ ing now .
you &apos;re too su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ous about everything .
so t@@ as@@ ty !
I &apos;ve never had problems before .
I probably should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the di@@ sh@@ clo@@ ths with the ser@@ vi@@ et@@ t@@ es .
I thought he would be up@@ set .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the sh@@ or@@ test @-@ lived pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons there is .
the milk is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he appe@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be im@@ possible to get a completely er@@ ro@@ r @-@ free c@@ or@@ p@@ us du@@ e to the n@@ at@@ ure of this kind of co@@ ll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative e@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ t . H@@ ow@@ ever , if we en@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ age m@@ em@@ b@@ ers to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te sentences in their own languages rather than ex@@ per@@ i@@ ment in languages they are learning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the wor@@ st thing you can do !
has he got any experience of f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing ?
Tom knows the city very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ in@@ ed everything .
because they &apos;re watching tel@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ on .
we &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
write your address here .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he was a w@@ and@@ er@@ ing pe@@ dd@@ l@@ er .
Tom w@@ al@@ ks s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly .
keep practi@@ c@@ ing , Tom .
I &apos;d like to talk to you for a min@@ u@@ te .
he already knows that .
all of a su@@ dd@@ en , Tom and I were alone .
th@@ an@@ ks to you , I sp@@ ent all my money .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
if you are to realize your dre@@ am , you must work har@@ der .
I hate the ti@@ e you &apos;re wearing .
I like this book .
mother no@@ ted that my fe@@ et were not clean .
I really loved you .
the girl is I@@ ri@@ s@@ h .
please per@@ m@@ it me to ask you some questions .
I was married .
he doesn &apos;t have his me@@ dic@@ ation .
each gener@@ ation would have to re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver for it@@ sel@@ f the tru@@ ths of the past .
it goes without saying that hon@@ es@@ ty is the key to succ@@ ess .
time to ri@@ se and sh@@ ine .
he did it an@@ y@@ way .
the pay is ter@@ ri@@ ble and the hours are long .
how old is the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wife is six mon@@ ths pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant with our first son .
this is hard for me .
they can &apos;t do that .
I miss his kis@@ s .
what are your re@@ as@@ ons for practi@@ sing Ch@@ in@@ ese me@@ dic@@ ine in the U@@ K ?
the neigh@@ bo@@ r asked us to turn the music down .
I tried to tell you .
I sk@@ i@@ pped out on my ap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment with my bo@@ ss .
he turned his mind to it .
he was ne@@ ar@@ ly run over at a cro@@ s@@ sing .
every country has its own history .
Tom made me read this book .
do I have to sp@@ ell it out for you ?
do you know the movie A@@ v@@ at@@ ar ?
even my bo@@ ss did not con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me .
God hel@@ ps those who help th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves .
which is bro@@ wn ?
this gu@@ y des@@ er@@ ves a me@@ d@@ al .
do you eat it in the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room ?
never tell me a lie again .
do not fe@@ ed the du@@ cks .
he lives in B@@ el@@ fast .
G@@ ir@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ es have very long n@@ ec@@ ks .
the house is on fire !
I get a three per@@ c@@ ent comm@@ is@@ sion on anything I s@@ ell .
you will give me this letter .
I wanted to speak with you first .
Tom ad@@ m@@ itted he had accep@@ ted a bri@@ be .
you can help .
you must pre@@ p@@ are yourself for the wor@@ st .
they think I &apos;m a m@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ re .
we mi@@ sto@@ o@@ k him for an Americ@@ an .
we must accep@@ t our ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence as far as possible .
I believ@@ ed you .
he li@@ ed about his age .
there is something I must know .
the box had been d@@ am@@ ag@@ ed , but its con@@ t@@ en@@ ts were in@@ t@@ act .
the s@@ lo@@ w@@ est one to make a promise is the most fai@@ th@@ ful one in kee@@ ping it .
this tel@@ e@@ phone is out of order .
I stre@@ t@@ ched out my legs .
you &apos;re very kind , Tom .
I did all the work .
make it as sp@@ ic@@ y as you can .
not bad for a begin@@ n@@ er .
Tom was looking at a picture of Mary .
they tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .
please write down what I say .
he had never for@@ given A@@ d@@ รฉ@@ la@@ รฏ@@ de for not having those heavy bre@@ as@@ ts , those wi@@ de but@@ to@@ cks that are a cre@@ di@@ t to f@@ am@@ i@@ li@@ es .
he was an@@ x@@ i@@ ous to meet you .
we list@@ en@@ ed car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly in order not to miss a sin@@ g@@ le word .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e put on her most beautiful dress to go to the the@@ at@@ er .
don &apos;t ju@@ dge me too har@@ sh@@ ly .
how many times did you do that ?
one of you two is going to have to go there .
&quot; can I write K@@ ab@@ y@@ le at Tatoeba ? &quot; &quot; what I say b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to the o@@ live tree . the words are no longer mine . &quot;
can you see anything at all there ?
he was all wrong .
give me some time to think .
the situation is very comp@@ lic@@ ated .
you will soon get to like him .
it must be the pos@@ t@@ man .
I took part in the s@@ por@@ ting ev@@ ent .
I sy@@ m@@ p@@ ath@@ i@@ ze .
I just want a little more time .
the moment I hel@@ d the baby in my ar@@ ms , it began to c@@ ry .
there are no or@@ ang@@ es on the table .
it de@@ p@@ ends on what you me@@ an .
I heard that he &apos;d died .
forget it . it &apos;s not wor@@ th it .
just reading a computer man@@ u@@ al is like practi@@ c@@ ing swimming on d@@ ry land .
please understand my pos@@ i@@ tion .
is it difficult to learn G@@ re@@ e@@ k ?
could you tell me how to ad@@ just the vo@@ lu@@ me ?
his house is by the river .
he &apos;s rich enough to buy two car@@ s .
Tom didn &apos;t go to the hospital .
that &apos;s where I was born .
that is a bo@@ at .
she was fin@@ ed 1@@ 0 do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s for that .
I don &apos;t see how that is any of your bus@@ iness .
l@@ em@@ ons are s@@ our .
Tom may know Mary &apos;s tel@@ e@@ phone number .
you &apos;re too s@@ low .
why was Tom killed ?
I always kept my promis@@ es .
Tom worked until 2 : 3@@ 0 .
why are you in@@ su@@ l@@ ting me ?
since it was so hot , we went swimming .
it &apos;s the best .
one of the ap@@ pl@@ es fell to the gr@@ ound .
don &apos;t be afraid .
a girl was as@@ s@@ au@@ l@@ ted on the m@@ รฉ@@ tr@@ o .
how big is your house ?
he &apos;s a fine young l@@ ad .
when we st@@ ep@@ ped off the bus we were immediately sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a th@@ r@@ ong of children from the v@@ ill@@ age .
set Tom free .
it &apos;s re@@ gre@@ tt@@ able .
I need a kni@@ f@@ e .

what time does school beg@@ in ?
is there any help av@@ ai@@ l@@ able ?

I don &apos;t want to go through another experience like that .
M@@ en@@ n@@ ad knows .

Sami rec@@ ei@@ ved his in@@ her@@ it@@ ance from his father .
I like the way you tre@@ at me .

do you work here ?
this re@@ ci@@ p@@ e is very easy .
it b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to my brother .
you have changed since I saw you last year .
is death the only way out ?
one can have an in@@ st@@ ant acc@@ ess to the des@@ i@@ red information on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et .
no one knows your s@@ ec@@ re@@ ts .
T@@ her@@ e@@ fo@@ re , for any t@@ ex@@ t you ho@@ ld the co@@ p@@ y@@ right to , by sub@@ m@@ it@@ ting it , you agree to lic@@ en@@ se it under the C@@ re@@ ative C@@ om@@ m@@ ons A@@ tt@@ ri@@ bu@@ tion L@@ ic@@ en@@ se 2@@ .@@ 0 ( f@@ r ) .

we &apos;ve only got one chance .
he will soon be past playing with to@@ ys .
let &apos;s start with the easy stu@@ f@@ f .
that &apos;s the man whose wife died .
nobody knows .
the only re@@ m@@ ain@@ ing re@@ gi@@ on in the world where o@@ b@@ es@@ ity is un@@ com@@ m@@ on is su@@ b @-@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an A@@ fri@@ c@@ a .
I often catch cold .
she took adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of me .
the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h for@@ ces were or@@ dered to se@@ i@@ ze the wea@@ pon@@ s .

I just wanted to dro@@ p by to say h@@ i .
the poor girl was bar@@ ely ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en .

I got there a@@ head of time .
everyone su@@ d@@ den@@ ly bur@@ st into laugh@@ ter .
d@@ ad is a hard wor@@ k@@ er .
I don &apos;t like how he laugh@@ s .
on the one hand we su@@ f@@ f@@ ered a heavy lo@@ ss , but on the other hand we learned a great deal from the experience .
why are you sorry for something you haven &apos;t done ?
I dr@@ ank milk .
we worry about your future .
do you like my T @-@ shirt ?
I know that Tom is a cook .
where did he get that crazy idea from ?
how heavy you are !
a f@@ em@@ ale friend of mine lo@@ ves to go to g@@ ay bar@@ s with me .
I &apos;m really going to miss Tom .
very little is known about them .
Tom put on some clothes .
Tatoeba is a language dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
what are you doing for N@@ e@@ w Y@@ ear ?
I &apos;ve already read it .
I war@@ ned you once .
my ho@@ st family often ad@@ vis@@ es me .
as he had worked longer than u@@ su@@ al , he felt tired .
I know you love me .
let &apos;s pl@@ u@@ g up the ho@@ le .
I &apos;ve come to see Tom .

K@@ ate knows how to make a cake .
no wor@@ ri@@ es ! this is good enough !
I feel so bad .
what can I get you ?

the B@@ l@@ ack F@@ or@@ est g@@ at@@ ea@@ u is a n@@ at@@ ur@@ al ap@@ h@@ ro@@ di@@ si@@ a@@ c .
which book is better ?
it isn &apos;t just for show .
I &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re not beautiful .
m@@ ag@@ az@@ ines let w@@ ri@@ ters write what they want and dec@@ ide how to l@@ ay it out a@@ f@@ ter@@ ward , but that m@@ ag@@ az@@ ine pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ z@@ es its des@@ ig@@ n , so it s@@ ets a pre@@ det@@ er@@ min@@ ed li@@ m@@ it on how many words are in it .
I &apos;m no different than you .
he told me good things about you .
you can &apos;t change who you are .
Tom has s@@ ec@@ re@@ ts .
do you love Tom ?
P@@ en@@ sion b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it p@@ a@@ y@@ m@@ ents are bas@@ ed on ac@@ tu@@ ar@@ i@@ al es@@ ti@@ mat@@ es using cur@@ r@@ ent as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tions for dis@@ coun@@ t r@@ ates , exp@@ ected re@@ turn on long @-@ ter@@ m as@@ s@@ ets and r@@ ate of com@@ pen@@ s@@ ation in@@ cre@@ as@@ es .
the book that I bought is on the table .
I re@@ gre@@ t to say I can &apos;t come .
I &apos;ll keep you pos@@ ted .
Oh , that &apos;s a sh@@ ame .
these are questions that matter .
Tom c@@ or@@ rec@@ ted himself .
what are you talking to ?
Tom wat@@ ched a Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ be vi@@ de@@ o .
that &apos;s a good reason , I guess .
so where were you ?
it &apos;s too th@@ in .
her brother is one of my good friends .
people make mist@@ akes in a situation like this .
do you mind if I take my shirt off ?
that s@@ ounds right .
I &apos;m Tom by the way .
her family is very large .
you &apos;re w@@ el@@ come .
is there any h@@ am left ?
they love coffee .
do you speak French ?
it &apos;s a hard , di@@ r@@ ty job .
now it &apos;s her turn .
would you please wait for a few minutes ?
any paper will do .
he gave in to the t@@ em@@ p@@ t@@ ation .
she likes to watch tel@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ on .
the only thing that really mat@@ ters is whether or not you did your best .
is Tom well ?
there are tw@@ enty @-@ four hours in a day .
I have to deal with this alone .
what &apos;s written on the st@@ one ?
we must do it quickly .
I had a se@@ i@@ z@@ ure .
she has a n@@ as@@ ty per@@ s@@ on@@ al@@ ity .
in summer , people prefer the sea .
there are two swimming po@@ o@@ ls , s@@ ever@@ al c@@ in@@ em@@ as , mar@@ k@@ ets , sho@@ ps , everything .
he did what I in@@ s@@ tru@@ c@@ ted him to do .
it was wonder@@ ful , wasn &apos;t it ?
she can speak not only English but also French .
if I had had more time , I would have written to you .
my bo@@ y@@ friend was crying .
that &apos;s quite com@@ m@@ on .
get me some coffee .
I want a lic@@ en@@ sed gu@@ ide who speaks English .
he spoke under his bre@@ at@@ h .
I sp@@ ent S@@ at@@ ur@@ day afternoon watching enti@@ r@@ ely too much TV .
I &apos;d like to go out with you .
public opinion plays a v@@ it@@ al in the poli@@ ti@@ cal re@@ al@@ m .
I would like to be your pen p@@ al .
N@@ anc@@ y has a piano .
Tom forgot to pay his r@@ ent .
he not only speaks French , but he speaks Spanish , too .
h@@ ab@@ its are difficult to break .
don &apos;t feel em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ed . these things happen .
I &apos;m not dis@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zed .
if Tom were t@@ aller , he could open the door .
he ne@@ e@@ d@@ n &apos;t have come himself .
maybe it &apos;s des@@ t@@ in@@ y .
they told me that they in@@ tend@@ ed to win .
what should I do if Tom c@@ all@@ s ?
you have to be pre@@ par@@ ed .
I have to get to school .
is there another so@@ lu@@ tion ?
did you see that ?
is there anything else we can do for you ?
there is nothing the matter with the mo@@ tor .
she got ar@@ res@@ ted .
I wanted you to win .
get the me@@ an@@ ing of a word from its con@@ t@@ ex@@ t .
we lost si@@ ght of the man in the cro@@ w@@ d .
this team ro@@ cks !
your parents love you .
she ar@@ gu@@ ed with him about money .
the po@@ pu@@ l@@ ation of N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k is sm@@ aller than that of T@@ ok@@ y@@ o .
my name is known to everybody in my school .

I &apos;m going to take two as@@ p@@ ir@@ ins before going to bed because I have a so@@ re th@@ ro@@ at .
b@@ lu@@ e is my favorite co@@ lo@@ r .
I know how to hand@@ le this .
she is a student at the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
do you have health in@@ sur@@ ance ?
A@@ h , when will they meet again ?
you are a very cu@@ dd@@ ly cat .
I o@@ we you one .
she was ar@@ res@@ ted and acc@@ used of being a sp@@ y .
no m@@ ea@@ l is compl@@ e@@ te without bre@@ ad .
just act as if nothing has happened .
Tom hel@@ d a glass f@@ illed with wine in his left hand .
they a@@ do@@ p@@ ted the or@@ ph@@ an .
your e@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ ts will be re@@ war@@ ded in the long run .
Tom is tea@@ ching me to pain@@ t .
I sm@@ as@@ hed the glass .
take a chance .
I think that Tom went to the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et yesterday , but I &apos;m not sure .
you know very well what Tom wants .
she was wearing dark bro@@ wn shoes .
here , I want to compl@@ e@@ te a few low @-@ l@@ ev@@ el im@@ pl@@ em@@ ent@@ ation det@@ ails that may be interesting to re@@ ad@@ ers .
I forgot to turn off the g@@ as !
did Tom sk@@ i@@ p class again today ?
we may as well keep it a secret .
she told me an interesting story .
take a de@@ ep bre@@ at@@ h .
I &apos;d like to ear@@ n some more money .
I can &apos;t tell you what we did last night .
I &apos;m really into fo@@ o@@ t@@ ball .
I had a d@@ enti@@ st &apos;s ap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment this morning .
I think Tom is drunk .
I &apos;ve never met Mary .
she dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed her@@ sel@@ f as him .
we can &apos;t let anything com@@ promise our mis@@ sion tomorrow .
Tom is still angry .
she has a fai@@ r sk@@ in and hair .
I hate my mother @-@ in @-@ la@@ w .
the c@@ ou@@ r@@ t ad@@ ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed that the will was v@@ ali@@ d .
do you have a pen ?
I thought you were ol@@ der than me .
I know Tom will be ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tive .
how much did you pay for him ?
we took a walk des@@ pi@@ te the rain .
more often than not , he is late for school .
the theory is too ab@@ str@@ act for me .
do you want coffee ?
she mo@@ ved to the U@@ S@@ A because her father died some mon@@ ths after you went to France .
Tom is t@@ all , but not as t@@ all as I am .
do you think it gi@@ ves me pl@@ ea@@ sure to not have time to look after my children ?
how about star@@ ting again from the very begin@@ ning ?
can you look at these two pic@@ tures and tell me which one is better ?
I &apos;m done with you .
I never said this job would be easy .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say .
did she kis@@ s well ?
it &apos;s not a question of t@@ a@@ x al@@ lo@@ w@@ ance but of m@@ or@@ al ex@@ h@@ au@@ s@@ tion .
succ@@ ess de@@ p@@ ends on your e@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ ts .
I hate di@@ et@@ ing .
don &apos;t leave your work half finished .
as a matter of fact , it is true .
let &apos;s just try it .
she broke a v@@ a@@ se by mistake .
I have class tomorrow .
what &apos;s the new boy &apos;s name ?
I an@@ sw@@ ered for him .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
can someone open the door please ?
he looks strong .
large c@@ at@@ ches of s@@ qu@@ i@@ d are a si@@ g@@ n of a coming ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
she mis@@ ses her father .
the train should re@@ ach O@@ s@@ a@@ k@@ a by ten .
I can understand that .
then , when he asked who had broken the window , all the boys ac@@ ted in@@ no@@ c@@ ent .
are you telling us the truth ?
Tom wants to say hel@@ l@@ o .
on the whole hu@@ man be@@ ings want to be good , but not too good and not quite all the time .
how did you get over the di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty ?
when did you start writing s@@ on@@ gs ?
Tom is sick .
that &apos;s just how I am .
I took care of her cat .
tomorrow we will en@@ coun@@ ter the en@@ em@@ y .
take wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever f@@ lo@@ w@@ er you like .
don &apos;t cut your fin@@ ger .
I &apos;m too tired to go out jo@@ gg@@ ing .
correct me if I am wrong .
a table has four legs .
he came back last A@@ u@@ g@@ us@@ t .
I appreciate you trying to che@@ er me up .

I would love to read a book on the history of laugh@@ ter .

do you want to go tell Tom about this ?
do you know who lives in that house ?
who do you work for ?
the work is practi@@ c@@ ally finished .
the dog must stay outside !
the f@@ il@@ m di@@ rec@@ tor , Al@@ ain R@@ es@@ n@@ ai@@ s , died in Paris on S@@ at@@ ur@@ day .
the si@@ g@@ n in@@ dic@@ ates the way to go .
she wanted me to lie .
I prefer plain mat@@ er@@ i@@ als .
as@@ ide from this , he was in good health .
some believe that the B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h R@@ o@@ y@@ al F@@ am@@ ily is di@@ rec@@ tly des@@ c@@ end@@ ed from the line of K@@ ing D@@ av@@ id .
I am not myself , my u@@ su@@ al sel@@ f having caught a cold .
I believe this is mine .
I hope you win !
do you think it &apos;ll make a differ@@ ence ?
I go to the library at least once a week .
I &apos;m not very good at it .
where are the others ?
open the win@@ do@@ ws .
why didn &apos;t you w@@ ake me up ?
I work in M@@ il@@ an .

it &apos;s a compl@@ e@@ te sh@@ am .
you have a tend@@ en@@ c@@ y to talk too fast .
even after it was hit , the po@@ le was still u@@ pri@@ ght .
how much longer will it take ?
Tom is a little di@@ so@@ ri@@ ent@@ ed .
the house was des@@ er@@ ted .
don &apos;t for@@ s@@ ake me !
she lives in ab@@ un@@ dance .
the living room in my new house is very large .
are you ready to do that ?
the or@@ ang@@ es in this b@@ a@@ g are ro@@ tt@@ en .
D@@ u@@ de , ser@@ i@@ ously .
I think Tom wants to s@@ ell us something .

my son can read a clo@@ ck .
we talked the night away .
Tom was up@@ stairs .
do you have some milk ?
I &apos;d like you to tell me what happened .
to tell the truth , we got married last year .
that &apos;s enough .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know each other .
I should &apos;ve just sh@@ u@@ t up .
P@@ au@@ l is so pl@@ e@@ as@@ ant a person that everybody likes him at once .

Tom bu@@ tt@@ oned his shirt .
she bought a shirt for him to w@@ ear to the party .
bad weather pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ed us from star@@ ting .
I &apos;ll do it , if you in@@ s@@ ist .
&quot; Tom ! &quot; &quot; Mary ! &quot;
you can &apos;t be in two pl@@ ac@@ es at once .
that &apos;s not true .
did you know that Tom has a son ?
this is the fas@@ test car in our sho@@ w@@ room .
it &apos;s a tr@@ a@@ di@@ tion .
what &apos;s this key for ?
and now you wish per@@ h@@ ap@@ s to learn on less f@@ am@@ i@@ li@@ ar tr@@ ap@@ s ?
what &apos;s the differ@@ ence between &quot; M@@ ay I &quot; and &quot; C@@ an I &quot; ?
I was surprised because my husband ac@@ tu@@ ally ate some of our we@@ d@@ ding cake .
your con@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ on is high@@ ly ar@@ gu@@ able .
half the office took a day off .
the l@@ ake has a very clear water .
does ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tive history exist ?
are you going to Tom &apos;s f@@ ar@@ e@@ well party ?
this isn &apos;t sugar .
what would you like for d@@ ess@@ er@@ t ?
the sk@@ y was b@@ right and clear .

I just fi@@ gu@@ red out how to do it .
I &apos;ve never seen the E@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ el T@@ o@@ wer .
she is mis@@ ch@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ous .
she felt happy to see him .
that girl is far from being sh@@ y .
I like gar@@ li@@ c .
she has for@@ given him for everything .
you &apos;re the only person I know who can help me .
Tom in@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly fell in love with Mary .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a dog .
the ju@@ dge hand@@ ed down a sentence of five years hard l@@ ab@@ or .
the par@@ c@@ el we@@ i@@ gh@@ s more than one po@@ u@@ n@@ d .
is there a sho@@ p at this z@@ o@@ o ?

Mary has for@@ go@@ tt@@ en her u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a in some bus .
I seem to have a t@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ ure .
don &apos;t touch my c@@ am@@ er@@ a .
that &apos;s how it should be .
I got all t@@ on@@ gu@@ e @-@ ti@@ ed when she spoke to me .
do you ever sleep ?
I did not be@@ tr@@ ay you .
is he afraid of death ?
they were just g@@ am@@ bl@@ ing .
I didn &apos;t ask for your advice .
I never l@@ end my U@@ S@@ B drive to others .
I sup@@ pos@@ e that &apos;s true .
what a qu@@ e@@ er story !
she scar@@ ed the cat away .
bar@@ king do@@ gs never bi@@ te .
may I drink al@@ co@@ ho@@ l ?
you did well not to fol@@ low his advice .
you don &apos;t have to think you aren &apos;t going to make it just because others have fai@@ led .
his idea looks a lot like mine .
you &apos;ll be the first to know .
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her .
he lived alone in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ si@@ de .
Tom wants to join our clu@@ b .
this is ir@@ re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar .
that &apos;s why I came back so soon .
not being wat@@ ch@@ ful , the dri@@ ver fai@@ led to stop in time .
it &apos;s really hot today .
he has a but@@ l@@ er and a cook .
I &apos;m really em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ed .
he is an hon@@ est man .
Tom does the sho@@ p@@ ping .
where did you find that strange thing ?
she was d@@ res@@ sed to kill .
I &apos;m a good t@@ a@@ x@@ i dri@@ ver .
do you really think Tom is better than I am ?
we &apos;ve got to fi@@ gu@@ re out what &apos;s wrong .
the work is ac@@ tu@@ ally finished .
if her t@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ ure goes up , send for the doctor .
one more drink , please .
you don &apos;t need to worry about wi@@ re@@ t@@ app@@ ing .
no so@@ on@@ er had he met his family than he bur@@ st into tears .
it won &apos;t hurt you to sk@@ i@@ p one m@@ ea@@ l .
I saw you with him .
don &apos;t drink so much beer .
I said sh@@ u@@ t up !
I just had a talk with your doctor .
we &apos;re looking for the tre@@ a@@ sure .
how are you feeling today ?
what time did you get up today ?
I hope you &apos;re all having a good time .
I need to go there .
no one could make the pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess l@@ au@@ g@@ h .
there is in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ ici@@ ent light to take pic@@ tures .
I knew Tom was a bit crazy .
I don &apos;t like your s@@ mi@@ le .
he made up his mind to marry K@@ ath@@ y .
why did you guys break up ?
they never drink beer .
does he live here ?
those who know do not talk . those who talk do not know .
this little pi@@ gg@@ y went to mar@@ k@@ et . / T@@ his little pi@@ gg@@ y stayed home . / T@@ his little pi@@ gg@@ y had ro@@ as@@ t be@@ ef . / T@@ his little pi@@ gg@@ y had n@@ one . / An@@ d this little pi@@ gg@@ y went we@@ e @-@ we@@ e @-@ we@@ e @-@ we@@ e all the way home .

Tom isn &apos;t very nice to Mary .
he &apos;s right behind you .
I am taking her out to dinner tonight .
the minutes became hours .
she asked him for some money to buy a new dress .
at first I didn &apos;t like him , but I do now .
do you consi@@ der them dangerous ?
O@@ s@@ car was my mu@@ m &apos;s dog .
I &apos;m very im@@ p@@ ati@@ ent to see the new ver@@ sion of Tatoeba .
there is no hurry .
I can &apos;t help but feel a little reli@@ ev@@ ed .
I know they &apos;ll all want to help you .
please come .
the company gave him a go@@ ld watch in ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ement of his ser@@ vi@@ ces .
s@@ ounds like a pretty good idea , after all .
don &apos;t run ri@@ s@@ ks .
Tom can &apos;t hi@@ de his an@@ x@@ i@@ ety any longer .
you were hot , weren &apos;t you ?
where did you get your hair cut ?
b@@ es@@ i@@ d@@ es , it &apos;s a really interesting problem .
who was it that bought this sk@@ ir@@ t yesterday ?
please remember to pos@@ t the letter .
a dog fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed me to my school .
please tell me what I should do first .
I &apos;d really rather be alone right now .
you should be res@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ful to your parents .
may I have something hot to drink ?
it was the first time that I vis@@ ited the mus@@ eu@@ m .
you look con@@ t@@ en@@ ted .
I don &apos;t feel like going out .
he has pl@@ ans .
his s@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary seems to know the truth .
in order to get the so@@ il ready for plan@@ ting you must pl@@ o@@ w it .
how can you con@@ c@@ en@@ tr@@ ate ?
you should read books b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ici@@ al to you .
I would like to have a cu@@ p of coffee .
your tr@@ ou@@ b@@ les are just begin@@ ning .
she is very p@@ ho@@ to@@ gen@@ ic .
this is very interesting .
do you really want to put your life in her hands ?
he can &apos;t be ill .
have I changed that much ?
he found his m@@ as@@ ter .
I b@@ le@@ ed easily when I am cut .
I am not eating my sal@@ ad , because I prefer cho@@ co@@ late .
I &apos;ll pay .
my grand@@ mother lived to be n@@ in@@ ety @-@ five years old .
I didn &apos;t even know Tom had a girlfriend .
you &apos;re very open .
I was exp@@ ec@@ ting you .
sh@@ it ! you scar@@ ed me half to death !
it &apos;s not quite as difficult to do as it s@@ ounds .
keep me in the lo@@ o@@ p .
that was just plain stupid .
we &apos;ve end@@ u@@ red three war@@ s .
she has pl@@ at@@ in@@ u@@ m bl@@ on@@ de hair .
I &apos;ve made up my mind .
I need coffee .
T@@ u@@ f@@ ts U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity is a very famous school in Boston .
you ought to have told me that before .
we are leaving this country for good .
I wanted to let you know about that , but Tom told me not to say anything .
this car is very e@@ con@@ om@@ ic@@ al on g@@ as .
I &apos;m sorry if I em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ed you .
I just don &apos;t want you to get hurt .

I feel like I &apos;m ready for that .
the person who bre@@ a@@ ks his word bre@@ a@@ ks also a hope .

English is an inter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ al language .
F@@ r@@ anc@@ es@@ c@@ o comes from I@@ tal@@ y . he &apos;s I@@ tal@@ i@@ an .
be l@@ en@@ i@@ ent !
would you like a little help ?
we can &apos;t do it .
they cho@@ se him as their re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative .
I think we &apos;d better take a break .
he became a pi@@ an@@ ist .
the rain has let up , so we can beg@@ in .
we had to stop .
just pre@@ t@@ en@@ d I &apos;m not here .
we must be ready for anything .
I knew then that I was right .
please cho@@ o@@ se a str@@ on@@ ger pass@@ word .

we will visit our teacher next week .
you &apos;ll never be alone .
don &apos;t break my heart .

she had b@@ right black eyes .
this is not a sentence .
can the la@@ w@@ y@@ er see me on F@@ ri@@ day ?
is France on the dec@@ line ?
why do you want to dress like that ?
I took her for an Americ@@ an .
you &apos;re the most hand@@ some man I &apos;ve ever seen .
he was caught with his p@@ ants down .
a@@ part from my sister , my family doesn &apos;t watch TV .
they spoke bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly .
where do you want to sleep tonight ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I hur@@ ried so as not to miss the train .
I was so afraid that no one would ask me to dance .
time pass@@ es , and it tu@@ r@@ n@@ s the wh@@ e@@ el of life as water does that of a m@@ ill .
which way is the che@@ ese sh@@ el@@ f ?
if I told you , you wouldn &apos;t understand .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like the same kind of music .
she can &apos;t find her keys .
what do you learn English for ?
Tom is a bit old , but not too u@@ g@@ ly .
Tom couldn &apos;t find the bus stop .
if you see Tom , please tell him for me .
I hope you were able to buy everything you need .
I had a really great time with your family .
this man is in@@ comp@@ et@@ ent .
fl@@ ying a k@@ ite can be dangerous .
I don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
it &apos;s not br@@ ain sur@@ ger@@ y .
B@@ an@@ ks will try to l@@ end you an u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a on a sun@@ ny day , but they will turn their b@@ ac@@ ks on a rain@@ y day .
you &apos;re st@@ all@@ ing .
you &apos;re afraid , aren &apos;t you ?

of c@@ ou@@ r@@ se , I knew it was dangerous .

I told you not to talk about the matter in her pres@@ ence .
we &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
I &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t go there because there were some lo@@ c@@ ali@@ zed heavy rain sho@@ w@@ ers .
her words were like those of an ang@@ el .
I have to dress up .
the sho@@ wer doesn &apos;t work .
we don &apos;t say that anymore .
and are there bo@@ ats ?
you don &apos;t want to do anything r@@ as@@ h .

I feel way more com@@ for@@ table now .
she ad@@ m@@ itted to having her@@ o@@ in .
I didn &apos;t try to kill anybody .
why don &apos;t you come visit us ?
I didn &apos;t know they were d@@ ating .
one must wait for the res@@ i@@ du@@ als to con@@ ver@@ ge before being able to use the si@@ mu@@ l@@ ation &apos;s res@@ ul@@ ts .
they &apos;re co@@ o@@ king now .
I can &apos;t live without a TV .
we &apos;re past that .
my father used to eat at this restaurant .
we should tell Tom the truth .
are you a poli@@ c@@ em@@ an ?

I &apos;m yours .
they never talk but they qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l .
we &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed !
I want to see them .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
one is never so happy as one thinks .
I have nothing to say about that .

I want you to help us .
I think you made the right choice .
what were you studying last night ?
I &apos;m dis@@ appointed and angry .
&quot; do you want to go to the ball with me ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really sorry , but I can &apos;t . &quot;

you might want to take a look at this .
all you have to do is to con@@ c@@ en@@ tr@@ ate .

I think we &apos;re out of d@@ ang@@ er .
it was pretty b@@ all@@ s@@ y of you to st@@ and up to the bo@@ ss like that .
I &apos;m on your si@@ de .
we used to play mus@@ ic@@ al ch@@ ai@@ r@@ s in el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a re@@ g@@ al@@ ed us with am@@ az@@ ing sto@@ ri@@ es about her trip to T@@ i@@ b@@ et .
where do you get off telling me that ?
can you pay me in adv@@ ance ?
&quot; are you ser@@ i@@ ous ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tel@@ y ser@@ i@@ ous . &quot;
I fi@@ red the g@@ u@@ n .
Oh you poor little thing .
he ju@@ m@@ ped into the water .
I &apos;ve finished .
I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an ol@@ der woman .
every mo@@ v@@ ement is pain@@ ful .
she liked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did war@@ n you .
that &apos;s my car .
I &apos;m not going to do that until Mon@@ day .
I me@@ ant to call her , but I forgot to .
you don &apos;t look very strong .
I completely ap@@ pro@@ ve of this .
Tom took part in the summer f@@ es@@ ti@@ v@@ al .
they caught Tom .
she was ab@@ s@@ ent from school because she was sick .
everybody wants per@@ man@@ ent p@@ ea@@ ce .
her s@@ or@@ row was only ap@@ par@@ ent .
J@@ an@@ e looks very p@@ ale .
Tom comm@@ itted su@@ ici@@ de in pri@@ son .
Tom is a m@@ em@@ b@@ er of the S@@ W@@ A@@ T team .
they had to change their s@@ che@@ du@@ le because the train arrived late .
&quot; qu@@ i@@ et , &quot; he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed .
you seem to know everything .
in two mo@@ ves , K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v will check the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger .
I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese cul@@ ture and history .
she looked tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me n@@ er@@ v@@ ous .
do you mind much ?
it is cl@@ ou@@ d@@ y now .
the show star@@ ts at no@@ on .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very un@@ der@@ standing .
French is my favorite language .
I think that she &apos;s hi@@ ding something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .
she thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to set our house on fire .
the wh@@ ale is well known to be the l@@ ar@@ g@@ est m@@ am@@ m@@ al .
that &apos;s true for every day exc@@ ep@@ t one .
Sami knows this hood like the back of his hand .
the ri@@ s@@ ks are too great .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en C@@ ol@@ b@@ er@@ t is a pretty crazy gu@@ y .
give it back to me .
Mr S@@ m@@ it@@ h tea@@ ches me English .
the el@@ ev@@ at@@ or seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time cho@@ o@@ sing whether I should listen to reason or my feelings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to wash my car .
you should get that so@@ f@@ a re@@ u@@ p@@ ho@@ l@@ st@@ ered .
the old woman is too wea@@ k to get out of bed .
even if it co@@ sts 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 y@@ en , I must buy the dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
he is so old that he cannot walk quickly .
please wait a moment .
pre@@ p@@ are yourself .
they ad@@ m@@ itted they were scar@@ ed .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjoy sp@@ end@@ ing time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ and@@ er up .
it &apos;s a fruit .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of eating at the school c@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ er@@ ia .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a m@@ ess@@ age ?
how l@@ on@@ ely and hel@@ pl@@ ess she must feel left all by her@@ sel@@ f !
as the first p@@ ack em@@ erg@@ es , the spec@@ t@@ at@@ ors take pic@@ tures with their c@@ am@@ er@@ as and mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ on@@ es .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I needed to eat less c@@ and@@ y .
I didn &apos;t s@@ cre@@ am .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can ex@@ plain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy h@@ ou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the gar@@ age .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a so@@ lu@@ tion .
he &apos;s gone into hi@@ ding .
Mr B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al ad@@ vis@@ er .
I am an ar@@ ti@@ st .
you should buy her new to@@ ys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ p@@ ping b@@ all@@ s .
she is nothing to him .
J@@ u@@ li@@ an w@@ ear@@ s r@@ ound glasses like J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fi@@ red from your last job ?
I like fun@@ ny guys .
I u@@ su@@ ally get up at ei@@ ght .
there is a big park near my school .
this des@@ k has lost one of its legs .
we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it r@@ ains .
is it possible to det@@ er@@ mine the di@@ am@@ et@@ er from the ci@@ r@@ cu@@ m@@ f@@ er@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 1@@ 0 : 00 ?
and on sun@@ ny days all the pi@@ g@@ e@@ ons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feeling O@@ K ?
Sami res@@ em@@ b@@ les the su@@ sp@@ ect .
what is your number ?
we believe in a better world .
is she still sin@@ g@@ le ?
I didn &apos;t enjoy the party at all .
she ai@@ m@@ ed at the t@@ ar@@ get .
we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dark outside .
I can &apos;t read A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ p@@ t .
they h@@ ated Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t agree with the theory that one should learn L@@ ati@@ n in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being ser@@ i@@ ous !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .
please pic@@ k me up by car in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of the hotel .
who gave you your n@@ ic@@ k@@ name ?
under n@@ or@@ m@@ al con@@ di@@ tions , the bo@@ il@@ ing point of water is 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ te away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve eaten in an I@@ tal@@ i@@ an pi@@ z@@ z@@ er@@ ia .
no one can den@@ y the fact .
ab@@ o@@ ve all things , we must not be sel@@ fish .
I have di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty con@@ c@@ en@@ tr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ w@@ el@@ ling on the pl@@ ea@@ su@@ r@@ es of the past .
I &apos;ll stay invol@@ ved .
this happened pri@@ or to rec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing your letter .
Tom likes te@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ y .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is b@@ lu@@ e .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the cur@@ r@@ en@@ c@@ y to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ it@@ ing .
ac@@ id rain is not a n@@ at@@ ur@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
we should pres@@ er@@ ve the be@@ au@@ ti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ si@@ de .
I can get us there more quickly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ m@@ p@@ et .
I think that fact is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I o@@ we you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 3@@ 0 .
car@@ ry these books back to the bo@@ o@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f .
have a nice trip .
the train is leaving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?
that has nothing to do with this .
is this f@@ ake ?
my father always re@@ ad@@ s the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er before breakfast .
Tom told me he &apos;d already eaten .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
she plays the flu@@ te .
they look so cute together .
Tom wi@@ ped his glasses .
it really h@@ its the n@@ ai@@ l on the head .
she has inter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ al r@@ en@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom sli@@ p and f@@ all .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s wor@@ th lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with n@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I bu@@ il@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ou@@ se by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the con@@ c@@ er@@ t because he had to work .
he &apos;s broke .
she is far from hon@@ est .
there are good gr@@ ounds for the vi@@ e@@ w that Paris was the s@@ cen@@ e of f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ vo@@ lu@@ tion of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef ou@@ t@@ line of the plan .
if I were you , I would ig@@ no@@ re it .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in this country .
I want a d@@ on@@ u@@ t .
I &apos;m in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks wor@@ ried .
I ob@@ j@@ ect to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h &quot; B@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory is where we study every day .
I like these h@@ ats .
we &apos;ll dec@@ ide later .
last win@@ ter , I went sk@@ i@@ ing in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
this so@@ f@@ a can se@@ at three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t exp@@ ect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please pre@@ p@@ are for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or sin@@ g@@ le ? do you live alone or are you in a rel@@ ati@@ on@@ shi@@ p ?
the sk@@ y is clear . not a cl@@ ou@@ d in si@@ ght .
I &apos;m not stop@@ ping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting down is not all that bad .
check these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it c@@ or@@ rec@@ tly .
Tom is as t@@ all as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s dangerous for children to swim in this l@@ ake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleeping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necessary .
an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous sp@@ a@@ ce station ori@@ b@@ it@@ ing around J@@ up@@ it@@ er over@@ looked the rain@@ bo@@ w st@@ ri@@ p@@ es of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the in@@ ju@@ red were re@@ mo@@ ved from the s@@ cen@@ e .
the train is ar@@ ri@@ v@@ ing !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cu@@ re for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the res@@ ul@@ t .
do not be sh@@ y . your pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the air was hu@@ mi@@ d and lu@@ k@@ e@@ war@@ m .
of c@@ ou@@ r@@ se , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost scar@@ ed me not to see you on@@ line for a whole day .
she is as fl@@ at as a p@@ anc@@ ake .
this ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le is more interesting than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you hit your children ?
be@@ au@@ ty pl@@ e@@ as@@ es the eyes , kin@@ d@@ ness en@@ ch@@ ants the sou@@ l .
our plan went wrong from the begin@@ ning .
I don &apos;t enjoy tea@@ ching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the re@@ as@@ ons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need te@@ a ?
a child should not get more sp@@ end@@ ing money than is necessary .
the pi@@ z@@ z@@ a is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his su@@ dd@@ en appe@@ ar@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom r@@ an out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al bas@@ e@@ b@@ all game .
Tom &apos;s in@@ no@@ c@@ ent .
everyone g@@ ath@@ ered together for the picture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
please re@@ f@@ er to the tou@@ ri@@ st information office .
don &apos;t leave the f@@ r@@ on@@ t door open .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be coming .
it was N@@ anc@@ y where M@@ a@@ x was supposed to meet P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a .
Tom and Mary was@@ hed the di@@ sh@@ es together .
Tom is watching .
b@@ es@@ i@@ d@@ es the rain , we ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed heavy win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but we@@ al@@ thy town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the s@@ even s@@ ac@@ r@@ am@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go ab@@ ro@@ ad .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing you .
does Tom still r@@ ely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted cl@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation .
let &apos;s worry about that later .
he hurt his fin@@ ger with a ne@@ e@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to res@@ cu@@ e him .
I fi@@ gu@@ red out a way to make more money .
this job gi@@ ves me the hu@@ m@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came true .
I hate people who have feelings .
have a nice w@@ ee@@ k@@ end !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; sto@@ ri@@ es . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all gen@@ i@@ us@@ es are eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers , but all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers are gen@@ i@@ us@@ es . the set of all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers is th@@ us an , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately pro@@ per , sub@@ set of all gen@@ i@@ us@@ es .
I don &apos;t think anyone thinks you &apos;re crazy .
Tom ig@@ no@@ red our advice .
we will be done in at most an hour .
I see her laugh@@ ing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her c@@ le@@ av@@ age .
we &apos;re finished already .
we &apos;re un@@ rel@@ ated .
it &apos;s mis@@ lea@@ ding .
the only one who can sol@@ ve this problem is you .
what a beautiful rain@@ bo@@ w !
you &apos;re a n@@ er@@ v@@ ous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at kee@@ ping s@@ ec@@ re@@ ts ?
try hard to ho@@ ld it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
you don &apos;t sound enti@@ r@@ ely con@@ v@@ in@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
it &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the s@@ cen@@ e of the cri@@ me .
it makes no fu@@ c@@ king sense .
his eyes were sm@@ il@@ ing behind his glasses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the pres@@ ident &apos;s new s@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
when is something art ?
please make five co@@ pi@@ es of this do@@ cu@@ ment .
do you have your p@@ ill@@ s ?
it s@@ no@@ wed yesterday .
don &apos;t s@@ ass me .
I want to take you to dinner .
I don &apos;t know when the meeting started , but it started at least thir@@ ty minutes ago .
it &apos;s not supposed to happen .
he hit me t@@ wi@@ ce .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never go@@ tt@@ en a s@@ pe@@ e@@ ding ti@@ ck@@ et .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish lea@@ ped out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than time .
are there any b@@ ag@@ s in this sho@@ p ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very ru@@ de .
he &apos;s pain@@ ting his house .
Tom looks like a fore@@ ig@@ n@@ er .
I had two co@@ pi@@ es of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go do@@ w@@ n@@ town .
tell me what you did on your ho@@ li@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicycle .
I &apos;ve learned so much from my mist@@ akes , I &apos;m thinking of making a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes s@@ low .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ for@@ d U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will snow tomorrow .
you &apos;re too n@@ ai@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ic@@ k and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re as@@ ham@@ ed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for mon@@ ths .
what year were you born ?
please dro@@ p in when you happen to be in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
he is e@@ ager to please .
I didn &apos;t catch your last name .
we &apos;re both w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ ses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a b@@ at@@ h .
you don &apos;t have per@@ mis@@ sion to do that .
I don &apos;t need any rest .
all took part in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the p@@ ati@@ ent was dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed from hospital .
do you think Tom can re@@ turn ?
I have no money to buy the dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
Sami re@@ f@@ used to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been studying music in Boston before I re@@ turned to Japan .
she vis@@ ited the old man in the hospital every day but Sun@@ day .
she came to Japan for the pu@@ r@@ pos@@ e of studying Japanese .
please take your time before dec@@ i@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted and im@@ pre@@ g@@ n@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ and@@ ed their fl@@ ying s@@ au@@ c@@ er in my b@@ ack@@ y@@ ard .
why did God cre@@ ate the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se ?
p@@ ass me the sugar , please .
that was co@@ ol .
is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
there was a heavy rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I m@@ en@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
they like English .
listen to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wo@@ re a red bl@@ ou@@ se .
I stayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ f@@ t .
the town was fu@@ l@@ l of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no in@@ t@@ en@@ tion of doing so .
the Earth and S@@ u@@ n are just t@@ in@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I su@@ gg@@ est we go out for a drink .
maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
do you reco@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the man in this p@@ ho@@ to ?
I want to join your team .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a c@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ er@@ ia in the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tr@@ a bed .
you should take care of y@@ ou@@ r@@ sel@@ ves .
be kind to little an@@ im@@ als .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ lowing down my computer .
my computer cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the des@@ i@@ re for le@@ i@@ sure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other ur@@ g@@ es , le@@ i@@ sure w@@ ins .
we still have more than h@@ al@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the mountain . are you really already ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed ?
few students can read L@@ ati@@ n .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I fin@@ ally found a use for this old thing .
I want to war@@ m myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I ad@@ mi@@ re your det@@ er@@ min@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can per@@ su@@ ade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay sin@@ g@@ le .
I &apos;m looking forward to summer v@@ ac@@ ation .
I made a po@@ t ro@@ as@@ t .
is she still sin@@ g@@ le ?
she is not as beautiful as her ol@@ der sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ es@@ us .
don &apos;t do@@ dge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ cks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en eg@@ gs .
you mi@@ sun@@ der@@ sto@@ od me .
I don &apos;t know either of his bro@@ th@@ ers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will ho@@ ld tal@@ ks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to pro@@ t@@ ect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the we@@ d@@ ding be hel@@ d ? &quot;
only a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le may get him out of it .
can I see your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se ?
this should sol@@ ve all your problems .
the man reading a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
did you have any lu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ ang@@ er here .
someone thre@@ w a ro@@ ck at him .
he kis@@ sed me on the fore@@ head .
M@@ ar@@ ia didn &apos;t su@@ sp@@ ect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her pen @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been c@@ or@@ respon@@ ding for mon@@ ths over the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et and wh@@ om she s@@ ec@@ re@@ tly loved , without ever having met him , was ac@@ tu@@ ally a sup@@ er @-@ in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ d@@ om b@@ it@@ es un@@ less it is att@@ acked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom m@@ ain@@ t@@ ain@@ ed that he was in@@ no@@ c@@ ent .
he is a man who is f@@ on@@ d of c@@ er@@ em@@ on@@ y .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big m@@ ou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of do@@ gs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is or@@ d@@ in@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look p@@ ale as a g@@ ho@@ st .
catch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the kids ?
ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y is often re@@ gar@@ ded as difficult .
the ra@@ di@@ o doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consi@@ der the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not exp@@ ect him to finish the t@@ ask in so short a time .
the sp@@ a@@ ce b@@ ar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ m@@ er@@ ic@@ al k@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s key .
that job is im@@ possible for me to do .
there is much sugar in this black box .
our mother had no choice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s .
these two l@@ ines cut ac@@ ro@@ ss each other at right ang@@ les .
she doesn &apos;t care how she d@@ res@@ ses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s smart , hand@@ some and poli@@ te .
don &apos;t put all your eg@@ gs in one bas@@ k@@ et .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for the way I ac@@ ted last night .
may you be tou@@ ched by H@@ is N@@ o@@ o@@ dly A@@ p@@ p@@ end@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she almost fai@@ n@@ ted .
how much is the ex@@ pr@@ ess ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only then did I realize what he me@@ ant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lo@@ ts of ph@@ on@@ es .
keep your eye on the ball .
I bur@@ ned my hand with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s im@@ possible .
we love our mother almost without kno@@ wing it , without feeling it , as it is as n@@ at@@ ur@@ al as to live .
it scar@@ ed me .
when I &apos;m hot , a glass of co@@ ol water really re@@ f@@ r@@ es@@ h@@ es me .
can you tell me where the ne@@ ar@@ est bus stop is ?
the st@@ e@@ w sm@@ el@@ ls del@@ ici@@ ous .
Tom tal@@ ks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; why is your room p@@ in@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m loved .
you still haven &apos;t finished p@@ a@@ y@@ ing for your was@@ hing ma@@ ch@@ ine ?
there is a ro@@ ck in my sho@@ e .
this dog will pro@@ t@@ ect us .
Tom is a di@@ ve m@@ as@@ ter .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
can I go to bed now ?
I can teach you something .
it &apos;s un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ able to date such a broken man , d@@ ar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your si@@ de du@@ ring this pain@@ ful or@@ deal .
look at this m@@ ess .
he is anything but a reli@@ able man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
sugar is so@@ lu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
it &apos;s not enough to m@@ em@@ ori@@ ze the for@@ mu@@ l@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you exp@@ ect to happen ?
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is flu@@ ent in German , but with a s@@ light Americ@@ an acc@@ ent .
she always exp@@ ec@@ ts me to help her .
go and speak to my col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e .
I do want to see you .
he was s@@ l@@ ain in b@@ att@@ le .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to bl@@ ame you .
I like cats .
why don &apos;t you use a ham@@ mer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I re@@ ach@@ ed the h@@ ill@@ top exactly at five .
it was tru@@ ly a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le .
what &apos;s your fin@@ al des@@ t@@ in@@ ation ?
once u@@ po@@ n a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
what are you going to do tonight ?
a bo@@ o@@ k@@ kee@@ per com@@ pu@@ t@@ es all the company &apos;s in@@ come and ex@@ pen@@ ses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bo@@ ther anymore .
he has a vi@@ de@@ o .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wonder@@ ing .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can re@@ comm@@ end this restaurant .
the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ e was es@@ c@@ or@@ ted off the pre@@ mis@@ es .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
K@@ ate has been given an op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to play a ma@@ j@@ or ro@@ le in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
show us the str@@ ai@@ ght p@@ at@@ h .
he did what I told him to do .
can you go to the office by train ?
the teacher was dis@@ appointed at my answer .
we r@@ en@@ o@@ v@@ ated a house .
who t@@ au@@ ght you French ?
you &apos;re the pre@@ t@@ ti@@ est woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
get out of bed .
they ru@@ in@@ ed it .
he works under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .
there are many par@@ ks in our town .
you must teach me , one of these days .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
tell Tom what you me@@ an .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , I already have pl@@ ans for that day .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
the whole city was d@@ ev@@ as@@ t@@ ated by water .
I have pl@@ enty of friends .
ex@@ cu@@ se me , but I think this is my se@@ at .
this is an op@@ ti@@ cal ill@@ us@@ i@@ on .
let &apos;s mo@@ ve !
it was a g@@ am@@ ble .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
my wife often r@@ ings me up , while she tr@@ av@@ el@@ s ab@@ ro@@ ad .
why does Tom have a g@@ u@@ n ?
you tou@@ ched my heart .
they got to be good friends .
ex@@ cu@@ se me si@@ r , could you tell me where the place of the c@@ in@@ em@@ a lo@@ c@@ ated ?
what are you watching ?
what has he done to you ?
ig@@ no@@ re him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a drunk l@@ ying on the ro@@ ad .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is be@@ coming more and more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
every day you should at least listen to a short s@@ ong , read a good po@@ e@@ m , look at a beautiful picture , and , if possible , say s@@ ever@@ al in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent words .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my living s@@ om@@ e@@ where else .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was famous for its h@@ ang@@ ing gar@@ d@@ ens .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the en@@ em@@ y dro@@ pped many b@@ om@@ b@@ s on the f@@ ac@@ t@@ ory .
I &apos;m here all the time .
did you understand any of that ?
I have no words .
don &apos;t forget to answer his letter .
don &apos;t forget to bring k@@ it@@ ch@@ en u@@ t@@ en@@ s@@ il@@ s such as kni@@ ves and co@@ o@@ king po@@ ts .
no , that &apos;s not true . Tom didn &apos;t change his name . it &apos;s just a ru@@ m@@ our .
you dead .
it was a close game .
whose is the dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary on the table ?
just be@@ have y@@ ou@@ r@@ sel@@ ves .
after lunch we have two more cl@@ as@@ s@@ es .
she &apos;s b@@ right and ar@@ ti@@ cu@@ late .
I &apos;ve never been to a pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al bas@@ e@@ b@@ all game .
we got al@@ ong f@@ am@@ ously .
the cap@@ it@@ al of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il is B@@ r@@ as@@ i@@ li@@ a .
where did you go ?
he decided to have the oper@@ ation .
N@@ a@@ om@@ i has just finished her work .
he married my c@@ ou@@ s@@ in .
I had a hard time trying to per@@ su@@ ade him to c@@ anc@@ el the trip .
she is very sh@@ y and fe@@ el@@ s ill at ea@@ se at parti@@ es .
I feel bl@@ ess@@ ed .
in the late 20@@ th cen@@ tu@@ ry , Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ l@@ av@@ ia was consi@@ dered a ro@@ gu@@ e st@@ ate by the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates .
that &apos;s what I &apos;d want .
hand me the ham@@ mer .
kids do stupid things .
you &apos;re very in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
it &apos;s all ne@@ go@@ ti@@ able .
she tou@@ ched my sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der .
she went there yesterday .
there &apos;s a lot of tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic today .
your face is always di@@ r@@ ty .
it happened here .
I &apos;ll fi@@ x a drink .
I &apos;d be dis@@ appointed if I saw you doing that .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
if we had known that , we would &apos;ve come so@@ on@@ er .
I can &apos;t be man@@ i@@ pu@@ l@@ ated .
what do you think of his su@@ gg@@ es@@ tion ?
open those do@@ ors !
didn &apos;t you read the man@@ u@@ al ?
he wants a play@@ m@@ ate .
she sp@@ ends all of her money on clothes .
Dan &apos;s m@@ ess@@ age was in@@ su@@ l@@ ting .
we wouldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
this hat is mine .

pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets t@@ ar@@ get tou@@ ri@@ sts .
I know you did this .
that looks like the work of a vi@@ r@@ us .
fu@@ ck your m@@ om , b@@ it@@ ch .
he who is not s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with a little , is s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with nothing .
why don &apos;t you try a different t@@ ack ?
I have been w@@ an@@ ting to ask you a question .
why not just kno@@ ck on the door ?
in France , where the si@@ te was f@@ oun@@ ded , Tatoeba has become a cul@@ tu@@ r@@ al and so@@ ci@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
I speak K@@ ur@@ man@@ j@@ i .
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark .
I slept all day .

what does this have to do with me ?
she has good sense .
he works in a b@@ ank .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
do you remember what you were watching ?
keep your hands up .
how fast !
I left it un@@ lo@@ cked .
go sit in the car .
when I g@@ row up I want to be just like you .
it &apos;s nice to live in this country .
it was not easy for us to find his house .
he is a lo@@ v@@ able person .
&quot; do you have a n@@ ic@@ k@@ name ? &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s R@@ ic@@ k . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t speak my language .
don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ e@@ re in others &apos; a@@ f@@ fai@@ r@@ s .
you can fo@@ ol all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fo@@ ol all the people all the time .
the pres@@ sure is building .
close the fu@@ c@@ king door !
he is interested in music .
reading books is my ho@@ b@@ by .
I like my st@@ ea@@ k r@@ are .
I never thought I &apos;d get that lucky .
Tom speaks French very flu@@ ently .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ately , that hasn &apos;t been possible .
I thought he would come .
I want this one myself .
it &apos;ll cost around thir@@ ty do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s .
he can &apos;t read it .
my sister &apos;s gu@@ it@@ ar is new .
Tom was lucky .
the little kids were very cu@@ ri@@ ous .
C@@ ap@@ it@@ u@@ late !
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
these shoes are too big for me .
what &apos;s the other con@@ di@@ tion ?
you know nothing of the world .
what do you think about this plan ?
I will .
I ad@@ m@@ it that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have a problem ?
the play@@ ers on this team are all gi@@ ants .
this one is the wor@@ st .
I was on the bus .
Tom has a secret wea@@ po@@ n .
you won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed .
it was so still that you would have heard a p@@ in dro@@ p .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
see you tomorrow !
he would be very glad to hear the news .
Dan sp@@ ent the night having se@@ x with L@@ in@@ d@@ a .
don &apos;t use your real name .
this book is really small !
K@@ o@@ al@@ as are cute .
I &apos;m never h@@ app@@ i@@ er than when I &apos;m by myself .
must I leave at once ?
a book wor@@ th reading is wor@@ th reading t@@ wi@@ ce .
was anybody hurt ?
it &apos;s d@@ ou@@ ble pl@@ ea@@ sure to dec@@ ei@@ ve the dec@@ ei@@ ver .
all you have to do is talk .
he can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an , too .
get the fu@@ ck out !
he en@@ jo@@ ys good health .
all the sw@@ e@@ et talk was just a ru@@ se to get her into bed .
M@@ i@@ h@@ o plays piano better than N@@ ori@@ k@@ o .
it me@@ ans that he likes you .
I knew it would happen so@@ on@@ er or later .
Tom is real cute .
they made me go there .
I don &apos;t know how to sp@@ ell that word .
is this all yours ?
Dan tou@@ ted his r@@ ac@@ ist i@@ de@@ as to his friends .
I don &apos;t like cold weather , but Tom does .
the cap@@ t@@ ain invited her for breakfast .
I live here alone .
did you guys ho@@ o@@ k up ?
there &apos;s really nothing more we can do .
I can &apos;t for@@ give him for be@@ having like that .
what would you do ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody help him .
Mary sin@@ gs best of all of the girls in class .
does anyone know what this is ?
you speak good French !
do you want help with that ?
I can &apos;t do it alone . you have to help me .
I &apos;m talking n@@ on@@ sense .
you don &apos;t seem to realize how ser@@ i@@ ous this is .
Tom won &apos;t bo@@ ther you anymore .
why did you come here today ?
that &apos;s more rec@@ ent than you think it is .
how can I u@@ pl@@ o@@ ad a p@@ ho@@ to to your we@@ b@@ si@@ te ?
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me .
Tom has bro@@ wn hair .
they lo@@ ad@@ ed the tru@@ ck .
it was cro@@ w@@ ded here all last week .
the A@@ T@@ M has sw@@ al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed my de@@ bit c@@ ard .
did you st@@ ea@@ l that car ?
my grand@@ father was born in 1@@ 9@@ 2@@ 0 .
Oh ! is it true ?
our first date was kind of aw@@ k@@ ward . I was really n@@ er@@ v@@ ous .
I have to write a letter . do you have some paper ?
women u@@ su@@ ally live longer than men .
I didn &apos;t understand .
he couldn &apos;t go out because of the snow .
the first b@@ low is half the b@@ att@@ le .
how old was Tom when he started talking ?
I w@@ ear glasses only for reading .
I &apos;ll get ri@@ d of them .
the ver@@ dic@@ t was a b@@ it@@ ter p@@ ill to sw@@ al@@ low .
he stu@@ died very hard .
S@@ h@@ in@@ ob@@ u is really per@@ si@@ st@@ ent . it seems that I am be@@ at@@ en .
today , there isn &apos;t any sal@@ ad , but only a large por@@ tion of f@@ r@@ en@@ ch fri@@ es .
some s@@ n@@ akes are po@@ is@@ on@@ ous .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to touch him .
I &apos;m broke and tired .
I u@@ su@@ ally take a sho@@ wer after I play tennis , but today I couldn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve been a big help .
everybody is sleeping .
I haven &apos;t seen him l@@ ately .
three years ago today , Tom and I got married .
I read s@@ om@@ e@@ where that an@@ im@@ als can sense an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake before it h@@ its .
J@@ im@@ my in@@ si@@ st@@ ed that I take him to the z@@ o@@ o .
the pr@@ in@@ ce succ@@ ee@@ ded to the th@@ r@@ one .
it &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen any dr@@ ag@@ on@@ f@@ lies in this ar@@ e@@ a .
Tom wants to say yes , but he can &apos;t .
you must listen .
he was be@@ at@@ en too easily .
they slept in the same bed .
I &apos;ve never seen you so happy .
you &apos;re not the only one .
come on , answer quickly .
she u@@ su@@ ally gets up early .
we are Australi@@ an .
could you let him out ?
my un@@ c@@ le is in his for@@ ties .
nobody can hear you .
don &apos;t bl@@ ame me for this .
watch your back .
I want to a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to you for c@@ all@@ ing you a j@@ er@@ k in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of your girlfriend .
no , I don &apos;t remember . I wasn &apos;t born yet .
they were we@@ al@@ thy .
which mus@@ eu@@ m would you like to visit first ?
you enjoy that , don &apos;t you ?
there is no s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
what ru@@ de language he us@@ es !
I have my own re@@ as@@ ons .
Spanish is s@@ po@@ ken in a whole b@@ un@@ ch of coun@@ tri@@ es .
I fin@@ ally found time to sit down and read the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er .
I &apos;ll b@@ et you can &apos;t guess what happened to me today .
do you know when he &apos;ll come back ?
would you mind if I kis@@ sed you ?
in English there are some words bor@@ ro@@ wed from Japanese .
Sami will spend life behind bar@@ s .
we &apos;re going to keep doing this until someone tel@@ ls us that we can &apos;t .
how could you say something like that ?
B@@ am@@ ak@@ o is M@@ al@@ i &apos;s cap@@ it@@ al .
the P@@ res@@ ident of France will visit Japan next month .
she came late as u@@ su@@ al .
let &apos;s be friends .
you were young .

I &apos;ll come back .
we &apos;re leaving now .
a wi@@ do@@ w had two d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters .
I love flowers .
we sometimes meet them .
come here and help me .
my de@@ ed is my re@@ fu@@ ge .
do you ap@@ pro@@ ve of what he is doing ?
your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se has ex@@ pi@@ red .
it is not you but her that he wants to marry .
no one knows where he lives .
I like to fish in the river .
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus .
I &apos;m ready to fi@@ ght .
it &apos;s sometimes necessary not to tell the truth .
what on ear@@ th is an inter@@ ro@@ b@@ an@@ g โฝ
you &apos;re not bad looking either .
what is wrong with him ?
it &apos;s not his st@@ y@@ le .
she &apos;s quite a hand@@ ful .
that store sel@@ ls me@@ at and fish .
I appreciate what you did for me .
Tom gre@@ w up in a small f@@ is@@ hing v@@ ill@@ age .
one more st@@ ep , and you &apos;ll be a dead man .
N@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ays many people tr@@ av@@ el by car .
come on , tell her !
I thought you were a friend .
are you fall@@ ing in love with me ?
he is afraid of the dog .
your fri@@ es are getting cold .
clear off the table .
we know you &apos;re interested .
who will pay ?
I &apos;m about the same age as you .
he &apos;s sleeping off last night &apos;s b@@ end@@ er .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between l@@ in@@ en and wo@@ ol .
people can easily start lo@@ ving , but not so easily stop .
N@@ ar@@ a is a city which I like very much .
we made a good team .
there weren &apos;t many boys at the pic@@ ni@@ c .
he speaks broken French .
I &apos;m in love .
he met his wife on@@ line .
I no longer remember him .
this is a secret .
there was a cur@@ t@@ ain which was co@@ ver@@ ing the door .
there is no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t .
if I could I would immediately stop .
thank you for stop@@ ping by .
miss S@@ m@@ it@@ h is liked by all students .
you are r@@ ap@@ ac@@ i@@ ous .
close the b@@ lo@@ o@@ d@@ y door .
is there any sal@@ t left ?
the pro@@ f@@ es@@ so@@ r se@@ em@@ ed to be lost in thought .
is that right ?
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
I slept the rest of the day .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
I &apos;m glad to be the one who tel@@ ls you .
this is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
how we@@ ir@@ d is that ?
please play something by C@@ ho@@ p@@ in for me .
she left France for Americ@@ a .
no one knows the fact .
I &apos;m 1@@ 7 , too .
we &apos;ll start again in the morning .
there &apos;s no sh@@ or@@ t@@ age of work around here .
you can &apos;t win them all .
have you ever played bas@@ e@@ b@@ all ?
it is not easy to be un@@ der@@ sto@@ od by everybody .
I &apos;ll hurry .
no one can stop me from going there .
they have one too .
why is she su@@ l@@ king ?
my au@@ n@@ t tre@@ ats me as if I were a child .
she fai@@ led and felt hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ated .
we should do better .
I think he will come to our party .
P@@ y@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as &apos; the@@ o@@ re@@ m al@@ lo@@ ws you to c@@ al@@ cu@@ late the l@@ eng@@ th of the h@@ y@@ po@@ t@@ en@@ use of a right tri@@ ang@@ le .
I just need to know what happened .
he ro@@ b@@ bed an old l@@ ad@@ y .
who &apos;s to say which is better ?
I don &apos;t take it per@@ s@@ on@@ ally .
I went to wash my hands .
you are talking .
why would you want to do that ?
Tom bo@@ il@@ ed some water .
you &apos;re up@@ set .
my heart s@@ ank .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
I an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated trouble .
life is very short .
language , as we know it , is a hu@@ man in@@ v@@ en@@ tion .
that is a p@@ ag@@ o@@ d@@ a .
is this going to c@@ au@@ se us any problems ?
the rain was dri@@ ving in our f@@ ac@@ es .
I &apos;ll give them to you as a r@@ ou@@ g@@ h gu@@ ide .
my st@@ om@@ ach started g@@ ro@@ w@@ ling right there in the meeting . it was em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ing .
he wrote down her name in the no@@ te@@ book .
I got here a little early today .
Tom has in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed the po@@ wer of his bi@@ ke .
how many mo@@ s@@ qu@@ es are there in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l ?
I &apos;ll spend Christmas with my family .
does this hurt ?
she doesn &apos;t speak much .
she knew too much .
he ex@@ cel@@ s all his bro@@ th@@ ers in s@@ cho@@ l@@ as@@ tic ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
the doctor att@@ end@@ ed to the sick old man all night , po@@ u@@ r@@ ing shot after shot of wh@@ is@@ key into the old man &apos;s open m@@ ou@@ th until he died .
Tom shouldn &apos;t be p@@ un@@ is@@ hed ; he didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you &apos;ve got to learn to be careful .
&quot; thank you . &quot; &quot; you &apos;re w@@ el@@ come . &quot;
you mis@@ sed the meeting .
I left the keys in the ig@@ ni@@ tion .
where is the to@@ il@@ et ?
can I buy only the l@@ en@@ ses ?
it &apos;s one thing to speak a language ; tea@@ ching it is a whole new ball game .
you don &apos;t sound con@@ v@@ in@@ ced .
what a z@@ er@@ o !
to my thinking , bus@@ iness is im@@ pro@@ ving .
have fun ! see you in an hour .
I want to know what I can do right now .
English has a lot of i@@ di@@ om@@ ati@@ c ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons to off@@ er .
I have to dress up .
call me if you need as@@ si@@ st@@ ance .
do you have a cr@@ ush on my brother ?
I &apos;ve changed . I &apos;m not the same man I used to be .
he will call for me about six .
don &apos;t let your feelings show .
I want to have se@@ x with her .
he was sub@@ j@@ ected to t@@ or@@ ture by the police .
Tom stop@@ ped me from leaving the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
she fell head over h@@ e@@ el@@ s from the l@@ ad@@ der .
they are pr@@ ou@@ d of their cl@@ ever son .
put that in writing .
I &apos;ll get you .
we all have a tend@@ en@@ c@@ y to think that the world must con@@ for@@ m to our pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces . the op@@ pos@@ ite vi@@ e@@ w invol@@ ves some e@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ t of thought , and most people would die so@@ on@@ er than think - in fact they do so .
this isn &apos;t supposed to be happen@@ ing .
who dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed ra@@ di@@ u@@ m ?
I know Tom is done .
I believe this man is lost .
Tom fell in love with the char@@ ac@@ ters in his no@@ v@@ el .
I &apos;d like to find out what this is .
since his appe@@ ar@@ ance has completely changed , you probably won &apos;t reco@@ g@@ ni@@ ze him .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t really have much in com@@ m@@ on .
it &apos;s here .
s@@ ci@@ ence will not sol@@ ve all of our problems .
he came in through the window .
the re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the lo@@ ad @-@ be@@ ar@@ ing b@@ ea@@ m com@@ promis@@ ed the s@@ tru@@ c@@ ture of the building .
I will in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce you to my parents .
I knew this was going to happen .
he d@@ ev@@ o@@ ted much time to study .
no one &apos;s watching .
you come from S@@ we@@ d@@ en .
my poor English cost me my job .
I don &apos;t have the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty to give you per@@ mis@@ sion .
don &apos;t be dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing .
she &apos;s vi@@ ol@@ ent right now . it &apos;d be better to av@@ o@@ id her .
take care of y@@ ou@@ r@@ sel@@ ves !
a pi@@ e@@ ce of cho@@ co@@ late a day kee@@ ps the doctor away .
I &apos;ve been working on this all day .
I &apos;d like to see her back .
C@@ o@@ c@@ a @-@ C@@ o@@ l@@ a in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed F@@ an@@ t@@ a , in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the S@@ e@@ con@@ d W@@ or@@ ld W@@ ar , for the German mar@@ k@@ et .
what &apos;s the point of your question ?
I sw@@ ear I &apos;ve never hurt Tom .
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
I was about to leave my house when she called .
don &apos;t you know who that is ?
she wat@@ ched him swim .
I de@@ e@@ pl@@ y re@@ gre@@ t having c@@ au@@ s@@ ed the accident .
she takes after her mother in every res@@ p@@ ect .
I don &apos;t know whether you like her or not .
are you av@@ o@@ i@@ ding me ?
I &apos;m not an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
I think we need a doctor .
it &apos;s not a question of good or bad but of better or wor@@ se .
she married a rich old man .
he wrote a lot of books on Ch@@ in@@ a .
this mountain is com@@ pos@@ ed of mo@@ l@@ as@@ se , which is par@@ tly co@@ ver@@ ed by m@@ or@@ ai@@ n@@ e mat@@ er@@ i@@ al .
some of them did very little work .
the room is quite small .
br@@ ush your te@@ et@@ h pro@@ per@@ ly before going to bed .

Tom was@@ h@@ es clothes three times a week .
I had enough sense to get out of there .
do you feel gu@@ il@@ ty ?
I &apos;ll talk .
your face is red .
it doesn &apos;t matter , right ?
Tom isn &apos;t a student .
we have no choice but to car@@ ry on .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I don &apos;t mind even if she doesn &apos;t come .
the dog is cr@@ un@@ ching a b@@ one .
when did you find out ?
her feelings were not re@@ ci@@ pro@@ c@@ ated .
his reason for not going is still un@@ clear .

his am@@ bi@@ tion made him work hard .
I &apos;m glad you asked me for advice .

how did your s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h go ?
he was afraid that he might hurt her feelings .
how do you like my new su@@ it ?

if it gets bor@@ ing , I will go home .

may I ask you to do me a fav@@ or ?
it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t cro@@ s@@ sed my mind .
Tom didn &apos;t look very well .
I &apos;m not married .
I &apos;d heard you &apos;d changed .
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions about what you did last w@@ ee@@ k@@ end .
today we must do what everyone else will do tomorrow .
Tom knows he will be p@@ un@@ is@@ hed .
did you visit the T@@ o@@ wer of L@@ on@@ don ?
the an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er spoke English .
I &apos;ve tried .
there were no problems .
how can you be so cr@@ u@@ el ?
I &apos;ll keep it for her .
there &apos;s nothing as pre@@ ci@@ ous as love .
I &apos;d like to make a s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h .
I had no al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative .
maybe we should start .
A@@ h , that &apos;s life !
both vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory and de@@ fe@@ at are but an ever@@ y@@ day o@@ c@@ cu@@ r@@ r@@ en@@ ce to a sol@@ di@@ er .
did you find what you were looking for ?
he thinks I &apos;m j@@ e@@ al@@ ous .
there were no cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers , so we closed the sho@@ p early .
she likes being looked at by boys .
have you worked the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le out ?
we don &apos;t always agree .
he den@@ i@@ ed having said such a thing .
you know I hate that .
R@@ u@@ g@@ by is an ou@@ t@@ door game .
there is more pl@@ ea@@ sure in lo@@ ving than in being loved .
Mary w@@ ear@@ s a s@@ por@@ ts br@@ a for ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
is Tom a w@@ it@@ ness ?
you &apos;ll get another chance .
who bur@@ ned the cake ?
why didn &apos;t you call me up ?
I have to pay more attention to myself .
everyone in the class learned the po@@ e@@ m by heart .
which un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity do you think T@@ ed will go to ?
you need to eat something before you go to work .
the f@@ re@@ ight train was hel@@ d up about half an hour because of a den@@ se fo@@ g .
Tom knows that won &apos;t work .
I &apos;m fl@@ ab@@ by .
may I ask you something ?
does Tom like Mary ?
he was sick , so he couldn &apos;t at@@ t@@ en@@ d the party .
I want that .
who do you like better , S@@ ach@@ i@@ k@@ o or A@@ k@@ i@@ k@@ o ?
the m@@ ag@@ az@@ ines were dog @-@ ear@@ ed .
I &apos;m s@@ av@@ ing as much as I can .
he was st@@ ri@@ c@@ t with his children .
here he comes .
you &apos;re in no d@@ ang@@ er .
the doctor ad@@ vis@@ ed me not to eat too much .
she got up at s@@ even in the morning .
I w@@ ear a su@@ it , but not a ti@@ e .
we will em@@ pl@@ o@@ y a man who can speak English .
the baby is sleeping .
he asked questions at r@@ and@@ om .
that &apos;s too hard .
tell Tom what Mary told you .
I can &apos;t tell you what an hon@@ or this is .
Tom dr@@ ank a glass of water .
he took the wo@@ od and s@@ a@@ wed it using the saw .
B@@ ig@@ am@@ y is when you have one wife too many .
there &apos;s no question of bo@@ t@@ ching this job . it must be done well .
you are t@@ aller than she .
it was a busy night .
he was trans@@ por@@ ted to the hospital by hel@@ i@@ co@@ p@@ ter .
I get d@@ res@@ sed and then I will take my breakfast .
he killed himself by taking po@@ is@@ on .
people are talking .
they said they &apos;re thir@@ st@@ y .
an@@ im@@ als are not to@@ ys !

I f@@ ly into a r@@ age easily .
I have no will po@@ wer when it comes to di@@ et@@ ing .
ear@@ th@@ qu@@ akes can o@@ c@@ cu@@ r at any hour .
I know your problem .
would you mind taking a picture of us ?
I believe she &apos;s 4@@ 0 years old .
he was the first to help him .
can I get you something to drink ?
please give me a cu@@ p of water .
you don &apos;t look very good .
I know Tom is in .
you must be fri@@ end@@ ly with your neigh@@ b@@ ors .
they are ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing .
I &apos;m used to being laugh@@ ed at .
the man ai@@ m@@ ed a g@@ u@@ n at the poli@@ c@@ em@@ an .
ro@@ p@@ es sur@@ r@@ ound the place .
I guess you think you &apos;re pretty spec@@ i@@ al , don &apos;t you ?
the sho@@ p was closed .
Tom sw@@ am with the man@@ at@@ e@@ es .
got it ?
B@@ ur@@ m@@ a is called &quot; M@@ y@@ an@@ m@@ ar &quot; in B@@ ur@@ m@@ ese .
I &apos;d like to try it on .
what does U@@ S@@ B st@@ and for ?
do you have a pen I could use ?
what Mary did did not please me .
there are a few y@@ ach@@ ts on the c@@ al@@ m sea .
go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e !
my fai@@ th in the next gener@@ ation is in@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
how do we find out what we need to know ?
but go@@ dd@@ am@@ m@@ it where did I put those re@@ char@@ g@@ ea@@ ble b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies ?
I met Tom when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
I don &apos;t have any choice .
most Al@@ ger@@ i@@ ans are I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ i@@ sts , some show it but others will hi@@ de it .
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast .
he will do his best to finish it on time .
we don &apos;t care what he does .
now I &apos;m wi@@ de aw@@ ake .
we must re@@ fl@@ ect on our fai@@ lu@@ re .
who is your fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ te Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ b@@ er ?
his dog appe@@ ar@@ ed su@@ d@@ den@@ ly from behind the door .
I can &apos;t get al@@ ong with him .
my d@@ ad &apos;s name is F@@ ri@@ t@@ z .
it &apos;s O@@ K with me .
it didn &apos;t work for me either .
they saw us yesterday .
F@@ red took a li@@ king to J@@ an@@ e and they started seeing each other .
Tom makes del@@ ici@@ ous co@@ ok@@ ies .
I &apos;d like to use a safe .
it could just be your im@@ ag@@ in@@ ation .
and it l@@ as@@ ted until early morning .
who could bl@@ ame him ?
he wi@@ g@@ gl@@ ed his to@@ es .
I found the love of my life .
do you want to sit next to the window ?
that was probably what in@@ flu@@ en@@ c@@ ed their dec@@ is@@ i@@ on .
the G@@ er@@ m@@ ans have won again .
are there any other op@@ tions ?
you don &apos;t know that .
they do it fas@@ ter than me .
bi@@ te your t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
I can &apos;t promise you anything .
we won &apos;t have enough time to do that before Tom gets here .
Tom to@@ s@@ sed another lo@@ g on the fire .
I can re@@ place him .
I am still young .
they are .
I think I know what this is .
a h@@ en l@@ aid an eg@@ g in my clo@@ set .
the t@@ om@@ a@@ to is a v@@ e@@ g@@ et@@ able , not a fruit .
wh@@ er@@ ever Mary goes , the sh@@ ee@@ p fol@@ lo@@ ws her .
please don &apos;t go home .
keep in mind that smoking is not good for your health .
this movie is really scar@@ y .
it has been fine for a week .
he must find work .
I am sorry if I am bo@@ th@@ er@@ ing you .
I like watching TV .
we get app@@ lic@@ ations from ever@@ y@@ where .
Tom asked Mary to sw@@ ee@@ p the floor .
speaking about love is making love .
they will agree on that .
you &apos;re dis@@ lo@@ y@@ al .
I don &apos;t know what your problem is .
what &apos;s your e @-@ m@@ ai@@ l address ?
Tom has what it takes to be a good teacher .
she is very f@@ on@@ d of writing po@@ em@@ s .
I hope that you aren &apos;t afraid .
I l@@ ent Tom my c@@ am@@ er@@ a .
am I the only one ?
would you like to come ?
Tom is poor , but he &apos;s happy .
our car is being re@@ p@@ ai@@ red at the au@@ to sho@@ p .
there was a par@@ ade to mar@@ k the o@@ c@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on .
who s@@ ent you ?
my son isn &apos;t the only one who en@@ jo@@ ys eating her co@@ o@@ king .
I just need to be alone .
have you any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
they &apos;re too f@@ at .
I know that he &apos;s reading .
Tom died a few days later .
I won &apos;t come tomorrow .
I just don &apos;t want to believe it .
the station is three k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ ers away from here .
don &apos;t ask questions , just come with me .
don &apos;t br@@ ake su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
I won &apos;t be coming until four o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ clo@@ ck .
I bought this hat when I was in Boston .
I agree with everything you just said .
what do you think of this red hat ?
this is not about money .
your con@@ du@@ c@@ t is perf@@ ec@@ tly le@@ g@@ al .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
my family isn &apos;t such a big family .
he &apos;s wearing sk@@ in@@ ny j@@ e@@ ans and a t@@ ank top .
I don &apos;t know how Tom got my phone number .
we weren &apos;t all that busy .
are you exc@@ ited ?
she looks very happy .
the end of the er@@ a of pe@@ tro@@ l@@ eu@@ m is in si@@ ght .
what does a w@@ ol@@ f eat ?
I want v@@ en@@ g@@ e@@ ance .
that is not what I me@@ ant to say .
you &apos;re fi@@ red .
Tom can swim no more than a st@@ one can .
do we need a P@@ l@@ an B ?
is there something I can do for you ?
I think Tom has been very lucky .
he gave the im@@ pres@@ sion of having much money .
it &apos;s st@@ able because all the ro@@ o@@ ts of this e@@ qu@@ ation are ne@@ g@@ ative .
could you please fi@@ x this ?
we speak English in class .
happy birthday !
well , it &apos;s time for me to run off . B@@ y@@ e !
are you ready for Y@@ 2@@ K ?
I &apos;ve just eaten some su@@ sh@@ i and drunk a beer .
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
do you think the weather will be fine tomorrow ?
at that time , my house was under con@@ s@@ tru@@ c@@ tion .
I hate hospital food .
the boys set up a ho@@ ck@@ e@@ y r@@ in@@ k on the f@@ ro@@ z@@ en pon@@ d .
I will act on your advice .
don &apos;t touch my stu@@ f@@ f .
he is not a teacher , much less a s@@ cho@@ l@@ ar .
Tom is your un@@ c@@ le .
I still have another sister .
&quot; what &apos;s happen@@ ing ? , &quot; mu@@ r@@ mu@@ red a vo@@ i@@ ce from the other end of the room .
I &apos;m good at playing the piano .
we &apos;re in char@@ ge .
you &apos;re the only one who un@@ der@@ st@@ and@@ s me .
how would you de@@ fine &quot; h@@ app@@ iness &quot; ?
I have not more than three th@@ ou@@ s@@ and y@@ en .
I &apos;m not a perf@@ ec@@ ti@@ on@@ ist .
I don &apos;t listen to them .
I just had to see you guys before I left .
please have a se@@ at .
I hope Tom laugh@@ ed at your jo@@ k@@ es .
men are born and re@@ m@@ ain free and e@@ qu@@ al in ri@@ ghts .
he had one daughter .
he was surprised too .
I &apos;m not your m@@ aid .
it has been rain@@ ing since Sun@@ day .
I cannot a@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ d long v@@ ac@@ ations .
he has a will of ste@@ el .
Tom f@@ ro@@ w@@ ned .
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job .
he was im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
that was sw@@ e@@ et of you .
L@@ u@@ ck@@ ily the door was open .
I should &apos;ve war@@ ned you .
I want to kill you right now .
you &apos;re pretty good .
he left his mother and his girlfriend in France .
how many students have been ad@@ m@@ itted to the school this year ?
she is sin@@ ging the l@@ at@@ est po@@ pu@@ l@@ ar s@@ on@@ gs .
the dog ni@@ pped at me .
that &apos;s a very old saying .
M@@ a@@ y@@ u@@ k@@ o was tired to death .
you must not think about your im@@ me@@ di@@ ate pro@@ f@@ it only .
I still haven &apos;t eaten today .
he &apos;s a con@@ tro@@ l f@@ re@@ a@@ k .
you &apos;ve often said so yourself .
you are not my mother .
she is qu@@ i@@ et .
on the first p@@ age of the second ch@@ ap@@ ter there are many new words .
don &apos;t speak un@@ less you &apos;re s@@ po@@ ken to .
they mi@@ sto@@ o@@ k my poli@@ t@@ en@@ ess for fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p .
have you been having fun ?
I am now in an old c@@ as@@ t@@ le .
here &apos;s a to@@ w@@ el you can use .
in a d@@ em@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y , it is important that the pr@@ ess be in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent .
when I see this picture , I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of our ho@@ li@@ day .
we are living in the at@@ om@@ ic age .
I cannot ap@@ pro@@ ve the pro@@ ject .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t think that .
you &apos;re leaving already ?
the police caught the th@@ i@@ ef .
C@@ en@@ tr@@ al P@@ ar@@ k is near where I work .
I don &apos;t need a lo@@ an anymore .
I think that he &apos;s probably not a bad boy .
I fin@@ ally found out what was wrong with my TV .
we &apos;ve all done things we &apos;re as@@ ham@@ ed of .
it took a long time to bring him around to our point of vi@@ e@@ w .
were you hurt ?
the P@@ op@@ e has no right to marry .
my mon@@ key r@@ an away !

my mother is very d@@ ear to me .
don &apos;t leave me !
I o@@ we a lot of people an a@@ po@@ log@@ y .
he in@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly fell in love with her .
M@@ ir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously , nobody was ser@@ i@@ ously in@@ ju@@ red .
that &apos;s a good story . the only problem is that it &apos;s not true .
I &apos;m not one of them .
Tom and Mary really loved each other .
what is it you do ?
the S@@ mi@@ ths are our c@@ ou@@ s@@ ins .
C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a appe@@ al@@ ed to the Un@@ ited N@@ ations for help .
I &apos;m from K@@ y@@ o@@ to .

W@@ a@@ x the floor .
I a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze if I off@@ end@@ ed you .
is this a letter ?
I thought you &apos;d be happy .
I found a r@@ are st@@ am@@ p at that store .
I wanted to meet a really mat@@ ure woman .
can you speak Ch@@ in@@ ese well ?
as far as I know , he isn &apos;t l@@ az@@ y .
it will be easy .
it &apos;s his st@@ a@@ g do .
remember that .
E@@ u@@ l@@ er &apos;s id@@ enti@@ ty really is re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
Tom is a c@@ y@@ b@@ er@@ s@@ ec@@ u@@ ri@@ ty ex@@ per@@ t .
I think Tom is con@@ f@@ used .
they were all surprised to see me there .
take some for later .
I can &apos;t seem to find your last e @-@ m@@ ai@@ l , I wonder if you can res@@ end it to me .
she met the man of her dre@@ am@@ s .
there was an ex@@ pl@@ o@@ sion .
I can run as fast as Tom .
it &apos;s hard to ad@@ m@@ it to yourself that you are a fai@@ lu@@ re .
I &apos;m kind of s@@ le@@ ep@@ y , too .
when I g@@ row up , I want to be just like you .
they tried to swim to s@@ a@@ f@@ ety .
please ir@@ on the shirt .
what &apos;re you looking for ?
I &apos;m aw@@ are of the d@@ ang@@ er .
I think that hel@@ ps .
Tom took early re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment on health gr@@ ounds .
I d@@ un@@ no if it &apos;s a bu@@ g or what , but this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are doesn &apos;t work right .
it p@@ ains me to dis@@ agree with your opinion .
don &apos;t you have any will po@@ wer ?
sleep is no less necessary to health than food .
it &apos;s more interesting to tr@@ av@@ el alone than to go on a gr@@ ou@@ p t@@ our .
do you have enough bl@@ an@@ k@@ ets ?
the h@@ app@@ i@@ est women , like the h@@ app@@ i@@ est n@@ ations , have no history .
the company is in the red .
we really can make this happen .
we were very lucky .
he arrived on time in sp@@ ite of the rain .
what on ear@@ th is it ?
he almost po@@ op@@ ed his p@@ ants when he saw that sp@@ i@@ der .
are they taking good care of you ?
I think that it &apos;s going to rain soon .
we lost our el@@ ec@@ tri@@ city because of the st@@ or@@ m .
I often b@@ or@@ row to@@ o@@ ls from Tom .
we were surprised at his con@@ du@@ c@@ t .
I &apos;m a busy person .
nobody tal@@ ks to Tom anymore .
there is no N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ c@@ s .
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I &apos;ve done it before .
Tom is comm@@ itted to r@@ ati@@ f@@ ying the dec@@ is@@ ions made by Mary .
he has seen better days .
he told me all the det@@ ails .
he is cu@@ tt@@ ing down tre@@ es on a mountain .
get out of here ! all of you !
how can you be sure of that ?
Tom du@@ cked Mary &apos;s p@@ un@@ ch .
I know what you were doing .
this me@@ dic@@ ine does not have si@@ de e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ ts .
I don &apos;t think you can be@@ at me .
I am c@@ all@@ ing back my wife .
I almost believe you .
seeing that you &apos;re not surprised , I think you must have known .
I &apos;m a bit ho@@ ar@@ se .
could I do it ?
this book has a lot of pic@@ tures .
we took an exam@@ in@@ ation in mat@@ h last week .
Mary hel@@ ped her mother cook .
Tom didn &apos;t leave Mary .
on his shirt there was a s@@ au@@ ce st@@ ain .
th@@ ou@@ g@@ h I speak with the t@@ on@@ gu@@ es of men and of ang@@ el@@ s , and have not m@@ er@@ c@@ y , I am become as s@@ oun@@ ding br@@ ass , or a t@@ in@@ k@@ ling c@@ y@@ m@@ b@@ al .
he told me about it in pri@@ v@@ ate .
the cats are safe .
do you want to go in ?
that &apos;s much more important .
theory and practi@@ ce do not n@@ ec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily go together .
he is a famous ar@@ ti@@ st .
I called you .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n is the t@@ aller of the two .
when did you get there ?
I &apos;m very for@@ t@@ un@@ ate .
does this ring a b@@ ell ?
I am looking forward to your letter .
we must try to pro@@ t@@ ect the en@@ vi@@ r@@ on@@ ment .
you think I &apos;m scar@@ ed , don &apos;t you ?
he closed his eyes .
at home everything is early , both tal@@ ent and b@@ al@@ d@@ ness .
I have no real choice .
it made me think .
H@@ i@@ k@@ ers need to car@@ ry a comp@@ ass with them to find their way through the wo@@ ods .
take a ti@@ s@@ su@@ e , your no@@ se is running .
I &apos;m looking forward to Christmas .
I hate black hu@@ mo@@ r .
before talking with Tom , Mary ar@@ m@@ ed her@@ sel@@ f with c@@ ou@@ r@@ age .
I told her to come visit us .
a boy r@@ an up to me .
it looks nice with your tr@@ ou@@ ser@@ s .
yesterday I was cl@@ ever and tried to change the world , and today I have become wi@@ se and started with myself .
you &apos;re not very fun@@ ny .
Tom was very angry with me .
don &apos;t you see who &apos;s fol@@ lowing us ?
with an@@ im@@ als I wish to live my life ; they &apos;re such great comp@@ an@@ ions !
how did they find out ?
I haven &apos;t seen any of his pic@@ tures .
I had har@@ dly walked a mi@@ le when it began to th@@ under .
there &apos;s a ru@@ mo@@ r going around that she got a new job .
don &apos;t talk to me like this .
let me stop here .
I thought you &apos;d be t@@ aller .
aren &apos;t you too young to smoke ?
can you tell me the time , please ?
this is taking way too long .
you &apos;re such an i@@ di@@ o@@ t !
I ate too much last night .
Tom has vo@@ l@@ un@@ te@@ ered to help us .
I am afraid of off@@ end@@ ing you .
in the mi@@ dd@@ le of di@@ f@@ f@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty lies op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity .
I would also like to get into the W@@ h@@ at@@ s@@ A@@ p@@ p G@@ r@@ ou@@ p .

she &apos;s a really nice person .
it &apos;s your money .
she h@@ ates parti@@ es .
that &apos;s something I like .
a famous ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect bu@@ il@@ t this house .
I didn &apos;t have the heart to tell you .
he &apos;s running for C@@ on@@ g@@ res@@ s .
Sami spoke little A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic .
there wasn &apos;t a sou@@ l .
please b@@ ear in mind what I said .
I want you to be qu@@ i@@ et .
I believe in you .
is this the boy you were talking about ?
the no@@ v@@ el has so@@ ld almost 20@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 co@@ pi@@ es .

Tom kept talking and didn &apos;t let Mary get a word in e@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ wi@@ se .
I don &apos;t have time to help you right now .
all you do is compl@@ ain .
I think Tom is reli@@ able .
I want you to come work here at our company .

the bri@@ o@@ ch@@ e is like the bas@@ t@@ ard child of s@@ pon@@ ge cake and bre@@ ad , but its feeling under the t@@ on@@ gu@@ e is the best under the h@@ e@@ av@@ ens .
I do not like the way he tre@@ ats others .
what is that ?
you pay me very well .
you should call for a doctor .
I looked for the key .

the h@@ e@@ at kept me aw@@ ake all night .
it is said that this hot water br@@ ings a b@@ al@@ ance between body and mind .
what do you learn English for ?

Tom went sk@@ i@@ ing alone .
a lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
they &apos;re right behind you .
how much time are you going to stay in France ?
take me away .
O@@ p@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans s@@ ell e@@ y@@ e@@ glasses .

my mother can &apos;t come .
I stayed there until he had left .
Tom found that a little bit o@@ d@@ d .

you can &apos;t do anything right , can you ?
I &apos;m s@@ mar@@ ter than you .
I felt reli@@ ev@@ ed when all the tr@@ ou@@ b@@ les were taken care of .
Tom didn &apos;t get up as early as he u@@ su@@ ally does .

R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers at the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of P@@ ad@@ er@@ born have es@@ t@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed that it took up to 20@@ 00 hours of English learning for a French sp@@ ea@@ k@@ er to speak English c@@ or@@ rec@@ tly . given that there are 3@@ 2 w@@ ee@@ ks of cl@@ as@@ s@@ es in a year and with 3 hours of l@@ ess@@ ons every week , 20@@ .@@ 8@@ 3 years of study are th@@ us necessary for a French person to speak good English .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
you have a nice family .
almost the only time a f@@ at man lo@@ ses his t@@ em@@ per is when he has been de@@ pri@@ ved of his food .
it &apos;s hard to understand you .
you have everything .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever eaten anything that you would consi@@ der dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing .
do you prefer w@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ les or p@@ anc@@ akes ?
he is used to that t@@ y@@ p@@ e of situation .
I &apos;m not the only one with a child .
one word is enough for a wi@@ se man .
I need to see you , and to see you again , and to see you always .
Americ@@ ans like fo@@ o@@ t@@ ball in the same way that Japanese like bas@@ e@@ b@@ all .

I want you to tell me how to do this .
Sami was working at an in@@ sur@@ ance company .
it &apos;s difficult to im@@ ag@@ ine life without tel@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ on or the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et .
a man is known by the company he kee@@ ps .
how did you get these ?
I &apos;ll go myself .
I &apos;ve man@@ ag@@ ed to per@@ su@@ ade Tom to come .

th@@ ou@@ g@@ h he is old , he is still e@@ qu@@ al to the t@@ ask .
I am eating an app@@ le .
I asked him not to bo@@ ther me .
she &apos;s looking at us .

once you have beg@@ u@@ n to do something , never give up .
could you read this for me ?
I can tell it all to my best friend .
he did his best to car@@ ry out the plan .
he took off his clothes .
Tom looked at the floor .
they were not pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed .
did we make a hu@@ ge mistake ?
I &apos;m re@@ tired .
he con@@ su@@ m@@ ed his for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ e g@@ am@@ bl@@ ing .
if they wish to des@@ tro@@ y their l@@ un@@ gs ...
you &apos;d better not wait here .
I &apos;ve never had to fire anyone before .
I wrote the no@@ te .

you won &apos;t stay , will you ?
she gave me h@@ ell .
I didn &apos;t kill anyone .
she was very s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed .
how much did the ti@@ ck@@ ets cost you ?
the children sli@@ d down the b@@ ank .
do you believe in a go@@ d ?
she thinks of nothing but making money .
may I sh@@ ar@@ pen my pen@@ c@@ il ?

maybe I went a little too far .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to keep his promis@@ es .
I war@@ ned you ; now do as you wish .
it r@@ ains so@@ f@@ tly on the town .
that might happen on Mon@@ day .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I &apos;m interested in what he does .
the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n , the piano , and the har@@ p are mus@@ ic@@ al in@@ s@@ tru@@ m@@ ents .
I have to remember to m@@ ai@@ l this letter .

F@@ ill out the qu@@ es@@ ti@@ on@@ n@@ ai@@ re .

smoke f@@ illed the room .
give me all the det@@ ails .
Tom was long consi@@ dered an in@@ v@@ in@@ ci@@ ble w@@ ar@@ ri@@ or .

Tom and Mary lived in the same town .
good night !
you should have told him .
I hope the e@@ con@@ om@@ y pic@@ ks up soon .

I &apos;ve heard of you .
I didn &apos;t see him again after that .
was that what Tom said ?
he called out for help .
I work in the fi@@ el@@ d of art .
you should think of this as an op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity .
&quot; may I speak to Mr N@@ ak@@ ag@@ aw@@ a ? &quot; &quot; speaking . &quot;
there are only a few mist@@ akes , or per@@ h@@ ap@@ s n@@ one at all .
Tom and Mary jo@@ in@@ ed the gr@@ ou@@ p .
he re@@ qu@@ es@@ ted that I come here again this afternoon .
I &apos;ve got a b@@ on@@ er .

Tatoeba is more po@@ pu@@ l@@ ar than ever .
I can &apos;t drive myself home .
he is a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ c .

I don &apos;t need an answer right now .
his man@@ n@@ ers aren &apos;t those of a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an .
why do you want to buy this book ?

how do you write your last name ?

the boy bo@@ wed to me .
Tom needed more time to finish his work .
can I use your pen@@ c@@ il ?
she gave him something to drink .
how did I let this happen ?
p@@ ati@@ ence is sometimes the most e@@ f@@ f@@ ec@@ tive wea@@ po@@ n .
when I got home , I re@@ ali@@ zed that one of my su@@ it@@ c@@ as@@ es had dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed .
it &apos;s never too late to make am@@ ends for har@@ m done .

she is for@@ ty years old .
have you ever eaten at that restaurant ?

Mary said to her@@ sel@@ f &quot; W@@ hat shall I do ? . &quot;
it &apos;s a tri@@ fl@@ ing in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent .
come down from the tree .
why don &apos;t you leave him alone ?
tell me where you &apos;ve been .
I don &apos;t know when he will come .
look up the word in your dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
I &apos;m going to die .
he was cu@@ ri@@ ous to see the inside .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to eat between me@@ als .
Tom asked for a dis@@ coun@@ t .

I don &apos;t know what he did , but it worked .
why are we still talking about this ?
don &apos;t try to talk right now .
where did you meet your bo@@ y@@ friend ?
you had never talked to me like that before !
he set a tr@@ ap to catch the an@@ im@@ al .
I think he &apos;s going to be sick .
he was born on J@@ u@@ ly 2@@ 8@@ th , 1@@ 8@@ 8@@ 8 .

I cannot accep@@ t your present .
you don &apos;t have to hi@@ de your feelings .
my father got home late last night .
he &apos;s a bit n@@ ai@@ ve .
you can &apos;t hurt my feelings .
we miss Tom ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly .
about four th@@ ou@@ s@@ and sol@@ di@@ ers were killed .
Tom has so@@ ld his house in Boston .
it &apos;s been hun@@ dre@@ ds of years since just one person could gr@@ as@@ p the whole of s@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge .
his car is g@@ ain@@ ing on us .
these books are heavy .

I &apos;m happy , too .
they were seen to go out .
who am I talking with ?
you have only to study hard , and you will p@@ ass the test .

I love you both .
you &apos;re a pr@@ u@@ de .
I &apos;ve already drunk half a bo@@ tt@@ le of wine while I was waiting for you .
the house has been em@@ p@@ ty for years .
I got in@@ ju@@ red in the tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic accident .
you &apos;re k@@ ill@@ ing me .
do you really want me to help you ?
but hu@@ man be@@ ings are different .
can &apos;t you en@@ h@@ ance the im@@ age ?
Tom p@@ us@@ hed back his ch@@ air and got up .
there are more important things in life .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s last name was .
I &apos;m sure I can find something for you to do .
to believe himself in the port of N@@ a@@ pl@@ es , all that was needed was to see the g@@ list@@ en@@ ing of kni@@ ves .
all I want is money .
we c@@ li@@ m@@ bed right up to the top .
how long have you known M@@ is@@ s S@@ m@@ it@@ h ?
the gu@@ es@@ ts are all gone .
an id@@ ea@@ l p@@ il@@ low is av@@ ai@@ l@@ able from a m@@ ai@@ l @-@ order house .
the right is on my si@@ de .
boys are more ag@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve than girls .
nothing ever makes him angry .
she said that she would fol@@ low him no matter where he went .
you don &apos;t have the right .
my bo@@ ss turned down his propos@@ al .
I &apos;ve learned a lot about mo@@ der@@ n au@@ th@@ ors .
Tom married a much y@@ oun@@ ger woman .
Tom was wearing his p@@ a@@ j@@ am@@ as when he opened the door .
Tom cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated his for@@ ti@@ et@@ h birthday the other day , without po@@ m@@ p or c@@ er@@ em@@ on@@ y .
you get out only what you put in .
he is con@@ c@@ er@@ ned about his father &apos;s ill@@ ness .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing him .
is English s@@ po@@ ken in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a ?
that class takes place once per week .
the vo@@ te is un@@ an@@ im@@ ous .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to drive too fast , but he wouldn &apos;t listen to her .
money doesn &apos;t g@@ row on tre@@ es , you know .
I thought it difficult for her to get the ti@@ ck@@ et .
M@@ i@@ y@@ az@@ ak@@ i is not what it used to be .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s grand@@ mother pass@@ ed away after a long ill@@ ness .
sto@@ ri@@ es often have happy end@@ ings .
together , anything is possible .
Tom is a n@@ at@@ ur@@ al ath@@ le@@ te .
they tried to dis@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ age him from going .
there &apos;s no need to be ru@@ de .
Tom has to call his grand@@ mother .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember ?
you &apos;re not leaving until I say it &apos;s O@@ K .
keep up the good work .
he was im@@ p@@ ati@@ ent to see his daughter .
I think we may have met s@@ om@@ e@@ where before .

we played . we lost . how about star@@ ting it over ?
Tom ab@@ and@@ oned his family .
you ob@@ vi@@ ously don &apos;t have time .
a friend of mine asked me to send her a pos@@ t@@ c@@ ard .
no one believ@@ ed his story .
after three hours in the c@@ as@@ in@@ o , he &apos;s $ 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 in the ho@@ le .
I hi@@ d myself behind a cur@@ t@@ ain .
father has gone f@@ is@@ hing .
who believ@@ es that ?
he had a cr@@ ush on her .
what is at is@@ su@@ e in this de@@ b@@ ate is the sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of our plan@@ et .
it was quite easy for me to car@@ ry the plan out .
you look happy .
I heard you .
why are you fl@@ in@@ ching ?

we &apos;re late because of you .
I made her c@@ ry .

I was thinking about getting a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce .
I hope your parents like me .
I &apos;ve been a teacher for 1@@ 5 years .

I re@@ f@@ used to believe it .
the trans@@ l@@ ation is true to the ori@@ g@@ in@@ al .
Mary was wonder@@ ing whether she coun@@ ted for Tom as a m@@ e@@ re word or as a real person .
have you finished writing that s@@ ong you &apos;ve been working on ?
I have three times more books than he has .
I &apos;m going to be your la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
I wonder if you &apos;d help us .
you &apos;re supposed to help your friends when they &apos;re in trouble .
put this sentence into English .
he doesn &apos;t study as hard as he used to .
they have scar@@ cel@@ y gone out since the baby was born .
why do you always want to do things the hard way ?
he walked through the for@@ est .
gl@@ ory to U@@ k@@ r@@ ai@@ n@@ e !

Tom is watching me work .
you didn &apos;t tell me everything .
have you ever been in love ?
she &apos;s short of money to con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ e her stu@@ di@@ es .
five years have pass@@ ed since they came to Japan .
he f@@ illed the glass with wine .

let her talk .
I know no one in this city .
she won &apos;t be pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed .

I see money , but I don &apos;t see go@@ ld .
I read the book .
don &apos;t speak ill of him in public .
there are no real vis@@ ions .
it &apos;s almost over .
he is less in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent than me .
what are you playing at ?
bas@@ t@@ ard !
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
he had es@@ t@@ ab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed a so@@ li@@ d re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation as a man of char@@ ac@@ ter .
I am not f@@ am@@ i@@ li@@ ar with his char@@ ac@@ ter .
what exactly is your book about ?
she goes to her family &apos;s home in France every summer .
A@@ p@@ par@@ ently , there is nothing that cannot happen today .
can you cr@@ ank up the h@@ e@@ at ?
can &apos;t you just leave me alone ?
I w@@ ai@@ ted up .
does your girlfriend like flowers ?
you aren &apos;t o@@ b@@ li@@ g@@ ated to come if you don &apos;t want to .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
she dri@@ ed her tears .
it was fai@@ r .
the teacher and I s@@ at face to face .
it is too good to be true .

she is lucky .
the dog looks sick .
he who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing .
I really miss you .
I don &apos;t like your s@@ mi@@ le .
it &apos;s not fun@@ ny .
Tom thought that Mary was as@@ le@@ ep .
we &apos;ll make up for the lo@@ ss .
the off@@ er is too good to be turned down .
why can &apos;t I play with my friends ?
I study English every day .
I don &apos;t trans@@ late for free .
the th@@ i@@ ef got away with the money .
just looking at her , you can tell that she likes you .
S@@ an@@ t@@ a C@@ l@@ au@@ s , I want to rec@@ ei@@ ve a girlfriend for Christmas .
Tom shouldn &apos;t spend so much .
I miss you .
parents need to set the ru@@ les around the house .
I didn &apos;t want you to get invol@@ ved .
he would often go f@@ is@@ hing .
the French are our neigh@@ b@@ ors ac@@ ro@@ ss the Ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l .
the la@@ w doesn &apos;t ap@@ pl@@ y to this case .
take a look around you .
you &apos;re not al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed in there .
that would be dis@@ as@@ tr@@ ous . H@@ e@@ av@@ en for@@ f@@ end !
you have a lot of n@@ er@@ ve !
I don &apos;t want to talk about this now .
that makes everything si@@ m@@ pl@@ er .
by the way , where were you ?
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
I knew this moment would come .
Tom decided to go home early .
world W@@ ar I broke out in 1@@ 9@@ 1@@ 4 .
who can tell me how a light bu@@ l@@ b works ?
I &apos;d like to find out what this is .
wasn &apos;t that enough for you ?
I &apos;m going to ask you something .
Tom knows very little about s@@ por@@ ts .
the phone bill was very high this month .
I don &apos;t have time to say this t@@ wi@@ ce , so listen car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
cu@@ ri@@ o@@ s@@ ity killed the cat .
are you saying I sm@@ ell bad ?
do you want to play with me ?
I love this place .

don &apos;t do anything by h@@ al@@ ves .
how can I tell if I &apos;m really in love ?
I &apos;m on speaking ter@@ ms with Tom .

you should be pr@@ ou@@ d of yourself .
Tom said he &apos;d like to see Mary do that .
I am h@@ ang@@ ing up my shi@@ r@@ ts .

who for@@ ced you to do that ?
she mis@@ sed him a lot .
I &apos;m not really your friend . I was just pre@@ tend@@ ing .
beg@@ gar@@ s can &apos;t be cho@@ o@@ ser@@ s .

did you see anybody ?
I don &apos;t need that anymore .
get up !
you &apos;re wearing the same so@@ cks as mine .

Mary doesn &apos;t like her pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion for a number of re@@ as@@ ons .
don &apos;t buy me pres@@ ents anymore .
why are you telling this to me now ?
being young , he can work all day long .

C@@ op@@ y this pro@@ gr@@ am on your computer .
I haven &apos;t had time to thank you pro@@ per@@ ly .
my wife is co@@ o@@ king right now .
I hate to wait .
f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly speaking , I don &apos;t think you have what it takes to become a teacher .
Tom wants everyone to get out of here .
the snow m@@ el@@ ted away when s@@ pr@@ ing came .
I have no idea who he is .
I am h@@ ers and she is mine .
are you sure about the cost of that car ?
I res@@ p@@ ect my English teacher , M@@ r@@ . T@@ an@@ i@@ gu@@ ch@@ i .
are you sure you don &apos;t want something to eat ?
that &apos;s pretty much all you need to know .
do you have any light beer ?
I had to get back home .
the last thing I want to do is c@@ au@@ se you any more pain .
did you think you were right ?
Mr I@@ to lo@@ o@@ s@@ en@@ ed his ti@@ e because he felt hot in his office .

I &apos;m not saying that we can &apos;t win . I &apos;m just saying it &apos;s not li@@ k@@ ely .
they were made of r@@ ou@@ g@@ h bro@@ wn lea@@ ther .
the sol@@ di@@ ers dist@@ ri@@ bu@@ te food to the re@@ fu@@ g@@ e@@ es .
I met your brother in the stre@@ et by chance .
I want to dr@@ a@@ w your attention to@@ ward last qu@@ ar@@ ter &apos;s res@@ ul@@ ts which are very en@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ ag@@ ing .
I should &apos;ve told you .
I &apos;ve got a good idea .
no sin@@ g@@ le s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate years of mis@@ tr@@ us@@ t , no@@ r can I answer in the time that I have all the compl@@ e@@ x questions that br@@ ought us to this point .
we all have different str@@ eng@@ ths .
I like to cook all kin@@ ds of food .
when he came , I was writing a letter .
the ju@@ ry is still out .
what &apos;s your real pu@@ r@@ pos@@ e ?
he knows how to play the piano .
have you met anyone yet ?
try not to eat too much .
I needed time to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce her .
you &apos;ve turned up at the right moment .
I don &apos;t like cold coffee .
I have enough money to buy a car .
did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
Tom can play the gu@@ it@@ ar , I think .
this hotel was very near the l@@ ake .
Tom went back into his office .
a car has one ste@@ er@@ ing wh@@ e@@ el .
have a nice w@@ ee@@ k@@ end .
Tom read the contr@@ act in secret .
he always w@@ ear@@ s dark clothes .
you &apos;re not f@@ at .
this is a good plan .
tell me why you were ab@@ s@@ ent from school yesterday .
everyone &apos;s there .
they &apos;ve changed a lot .
talking to Tom isn &apos;t going to help .
you have the adv@@ an@@ t@@ age of a good e@@ du@@ c@@ ation .
Tom does what he wants to .
no one fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed us .
what cri@@ ter@@ i@@ on did you use when you el@@ ected this ess@@ ay as the win@@ n@@ er ?
he was so ch@@ il@@ dis@@ h that he couldn &apos;t res@@ ist t@@ em@@ p@@ t@@ ation .
it &apos;s a d@@ ou@@ ble @-@ e@@ d@@ g@@ ed s@@ word .
Sami should as@@ su@@ me respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty .
I was ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly fri@@ gh@@ t@@ en@@ ed .
&quot; when will you come back ? &quot; &quot; it all de@@ p@@ ends on the weather . &quot;
she br@@ us@@ hed away the d@@ us@@ t .
she took her time .
you &apos;re com@@ par@@ ing ap@@ pl@@ es and or@@ ang@@ es !
there are many w@@ il@@ d an@@ im@@ als in this ar@@ e@@ a .
she spoke only German .
Sami hasn &apos;t even finished reading one p@@ age .
are you going to ar@@ rest me ?
you &apos;re not to@@ t@@ ally bl@@ am@@ el@@ ess .
in g@@ am@@ es of chance , it &apos;s very important to know the pro@@ b@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties of ev@@ ents .
does this b@@ ack@@ p@@ ack b@@ el@@ ong to him ?
are you sure that it was Tom ?
my grand@@ father no longer has a dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ en@@ se .
I have here my brother &apos;s daughter with her kids .
what s@@ or@@ t of information do you get on the In@@ ter@@ n@@ et ?
one of the li@@ ghts is not working . do you think you could come take a look ?
he likes swimming in the summer .
I want a thir@@ d al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative .
it seems that I@@ tal@@ i@@ ans are pr@@ one to su@@ f@@ f@@ er from ex@@ cl@@ us@@ i@@ ve ai@@ l@@ m@@ ents that have no n@@ am@@ es in other cul@@ tures .
she &apos;ll tell him about it when she comes back .

I didn &apos;t si@@ g@@ n up for this .
I can &apos;t break this co@@ de .
you just wouldn &apos;t understand .
I thought you were in@@ ju@@ red .
he wasn &apos;t your brother .
the mus@@ eu@@ m cur@@ at@@ or wanted the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an pain@@ ting to be s@@ and@@ wi@@ ched between two pi@@ ec@@ es of th@@ ic@@ k ac@@ r@@ y@@ li@@ c glass .
many coun@@ tri@@ es have problems with po@@ ver@@ ty .
I &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re completely so@@ ld out .
that &apos;s no longer al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed .
they want me to or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ ze the party .
that &apos;s why I s@@ ent for you .
can you tell me about that con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation ?
her name was un@@ known .
why have you for@@ go@@ tt@@ en the po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es and not the beer ?
did you tell Tom he could b@@ or@@ row your car ?
there are some people who hate the idea of the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an C@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ ity .
sometimes I smoke just to give my hands something to do .
you look a little sh@@ a@@ ken .
B@@ on vo@@ y@@ age !
there are people here who need your help .
that store closed in 20@@ 1@@ 3 .
I &apos;m sure of my ri@@ ghts .
I saw her there .
she ai@@ m@@ ed at the t@@ ar@@ get .
all of my students call me by my first name .
that l@@ ec@@ ture really sti@@ mu@@ l@@ ated me .
I am looking forward to h@@ ear@@ ing from him .
Tom was a mo@@ d@@ el in@@ m@@ ate .
Tom plays the tr@@ om@@ b@@ one .
where do Tom and Mary study ?
that isn &apos;t big enough .
N@@ e@@ w@@ t@@ on thought the world had been cre@@ ated in 4@@ 0@@ 00 B@@ C .
I like a good cu@@ p of coffee .
this is st@@ ri@@ c@@ tly for@@ bi@@ dd@@ en .
vi@@ ol@@ ent ex@@ tre@@ mi@@ sts have ex@@ pl@@ o@@ ited these t@@ en@@ si@@ ons in a small but po@@ t@@ ent min@@ ori@@ ty of M@@ us@@ li@@ ms .

I no longer live here .
you should go and see for yourself .
she comes from C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
he has no sp@@ ati@@ al aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess .
Tom didn &apos;t act quickly enough .
the floor is sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
the wh@@ ale is not a fish but a m@@ am@@ m@@ al .
what do you plan on doing with the money ?
it &apos;s already 2 : 3@@ 0 and Tom isn &apos;t here yet .
tomorrow &apos;s to@@ t@@ al ec@@ li@@ p@@ se of the sun will be vis@@ i@@ ble from the sou@@ th@@ er@@ n h@@ em@@ is@@ p@@ here .

you almost gave me a heart att@@ ack .
it seems that something has happened .

I have never been to that town .
when did you come back from G@@ er@@ many ?
he mi@@ sto@@ o@@ k me for my tw@@ in brother .

I can &apos;t pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly man@@ age it .

he made re@@ f@@ er@@ ence to the pre@@ vi@@ ous di@@ rec@@ tor .
pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed to meet you .
I didn &apos;t know that you car@@ ed .
we can see a ch@@ ur@@ ch over there .

what &apos;s your favorite way to cook be@@ ans ?

I know I should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
the secret of good pro@@ se res@@ i@@ d@@ es in the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the language .
I want you to get out of town .

no one was in the park .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e &apos;s back from Ch@@ in@@ a .
am I ready ?
books must fol@@ low s@@ ci@@ ences , and not s@@ ci@@ ences books .
at first , French was a di@@ al@@ ect .
how did you learn to cook so well ?
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed to working hard .
she doesn &apos;t even know that I exist .
he lives in E@@ n@@ gl@@ and .
I am not used to being s@@ po@@ ken to in that ru@@ de way .
are you ready for Christmas ?
ex@@ pres@@ si@@ ons and sm@@ il@@ es change like that just from ap@@ pl@@ ying r@@ ou@@ ge and li@@ p@@ sti@@ ck .
one father is more than a hun@@ d@@ red s@@ cho@@ ol@@ m@@ as@@ ters .
all the students are studying English .
don &apos;t k@@ id me !
I don &apos;t remember what it was about .
it &apos;s a sh@@ ame .
I &apos;m lu@@ st@@ ing after him .
how much does my de@@ b@@ t am@@ oun@@ t to ?
those who want hon@@ e@@ y must not be afraid of be@@ es .
he is not at all a g@@ ent@@ l@@ em@@ an .
as is often the case with her , she didn &apos;t show up on time .
don &apos;t you remember my name ?
I &apos;m still not s@@ ati@@ s@@ fi@@ ed .
they ad@@ m@@ itted they were l@@ az@@ y .
I &apos;m surprised that B@@ et@@ h didn &apos;t enjoy her time at the f@@ ar@@ m .
you probably just want to be alone .
Tom wanted Mary to meet his friends .
he probably has a girlfriend already .
there are a lot of bri@@ d@@ g@@ es in this city .
is there an@@ y@@ where you want to go ?
I got busy .
Tom is a go@@ l@@ d@@ sm@@ it@@ h .
&quot; don &apos;t c@@ ry , &quot; she said .
I think you might need some help .

did you see my cat ?
R@@ i@@ ch@@ ard O@@ f Y@@ or@@ k G@@ av@@ e B@@ att@@ le I@@ n V@@ ain .
it is all I want to do .
you must read between the l@@ ines .
I a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ zed for having been late for school .
I can &apos;t help you today .
the so@@ c@@ c@@ er ball is r@@ ound .
the dog was dead .
the eye is s@@ en@@ si@@ tive to light .
you should have been more careful .
you will get the wor@@ st be@@ ating of your life .
I &apos;m l@@ on@@ ely without you .
we are ho@@ ping to visit S@@ pain this summer .
Tom hasn &apos;t said a word .
he used to read a lot .
is that un@@ der@@ sto@@ od ?
is it all right to eat out tonight ?
my parents s@@ ent me to f@@ at c@@ am@@ p when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
she seems to be interested in him .
how did you find me ?
the girl p@@ au@@ s@@ ed and sm@@ il@@ ed ; the young man p@@ au@@ s@@ ed and si@@ gh@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
they all came by bi@@ ke .
you should not sleep .
living without ill@@ us@@ ions is the secret to h@@ app@@ iness .
it was just as I thought .
take this to your mother .
don &apos;t forget to send that letter .
why are you so interested ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a dec@@ ent car .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
to tell the truth , I completely forgot .
have you gone crazy ?
she has never fall@@ en in love .
I was at the party .
this t@@ y@@ p@@ e of person is bor@@ ing .
B@@ y@@ e , S@@ a@@ y@@ ok@@ o !
he lost a for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ e in the sto@@ ck mar@@ k@@ et .
s@@ ec@@ tion 9 of the E@@ n@@ d@@ ang@@ er@@ ed S@@ p@@ ec@@ ies A@@ c@@ t makes it il@@ le@@ g@@ al to take an end@@ ang@@ er@@ ed spec@@ ies of fish or w@@ il@@ d@@ life .
yes , that was am@@ az@@ ing . Un@@ believ@@ able !
what do you want to see while you &apos;re here ?
I wonder if anything happened to him .
I love all of you .
what &apos;s going on down there ?
it is pre@@ mat@@ ure to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s it now .
no one knows her .
we often hear you sing .
he di@@ f@@ f@@ ers from his brother .
when are you going home ?
they w@@ av@@ ed fl@@ ag@@ s to w@@ el@@ come the pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess .
he was be@@ coming a famous sin@@ ger .
I qu@@ it smoking .
I know that you and Tom are friends .
we were att@@ acked by sw@@ ar@@ ms of be@@ es .
f@@ ear is a bad ad@@ vis@@ er .
it &apos;s a very small pri@@ ce for such an important vi@@ c@@ t@@ ory .
Sami didn &apos;t want to be sh@@ am@@ ed in the v@@ ill@@ age by his che@@ ating wife .
Tom isn &apos;t a min@@ or .
Tom took out a b@@ a@@ g of mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ ws .
you know this isn &apos;t the way we should be doing this .
I gave the house to you .
what do you re@@ gre@@ t most ?
don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t war@@ n you .
the little girl , de@@ e@@ pl@@ y mo@@ ved by the old man &apos;s pi@@ ti@@ ful story , bur@@ st into tears .
it de@@ p@@ ends on how much money you have .
he wants to be a doctor in the future .
he likes taking w@@ al@@ ks .
what are your con@@ cl@@ us@@ ions ?
put the p@@ li@@ ers in the to@@ ol box .
the r@@ ou@@ te was b@@ lo@@ cked by a tree .
I often played tru@@ ant .
Tom has co@@ ll@@ ected a great many but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies .
now sh@@ ake hands and make up .
the S@@ u@@ n sm@@ il@@ ed through the window every morning .
I was in way over my head .
I have no parti@@ cul@@ ar tal@@ ent .
Tom knew this was going to happen .
guess what I found on the b@@ each .
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot .
the girl who lives next door is very pretty .
we should have told him the truth .
they are out sho@@ p@@ ping .
Tom is det@@ er@@ min@@ ed to lose we@@ ight .
they are ac@@ t@@ ors .
I &apos;m looking for someone who can speak P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese .
some people say that the theory of ev@@ o@@ lu@@ tion is &quot; only &quot; a theory but a s@@ ci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c theory is something that has been pro@@ v@@ en to be true .
there &apos;s no so@@ ap .
I felt de@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
they sp@@ ent the afternoon around the po@@ ol .
I couldn &apos;t find it an@@ y@@ where .
can you show me ?
we &apos;ll take part in the mar@@ ath@@ on .
what &apos;s your di@@ ag@@ no@@ s@@ is ?
s@@ om@@ e@@ day the U@@ S@@ A will el@@ ect a woman pres@@ ident , and it won &apos;t be pretty .
if you tell Tom what to do , he &apos;ll do it .
this an@@ im@@ al is mine .
it &apos;s A@@ pri@@ l first .
he will soon get used to the c@@ li@@ m@@ ate here .
what kind of person am I ?
I ad@@ mi@@ re your ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance .
if I s@@ cre@@ w up , what &apos;s the wor@@ st that can happen ?
what you did to Tom was cr@@ u@@ el .
that ro@@ ck b@@ and gi@@ ves me a h@@ ea@@ d@@ a@@ ch@@ e .
I can &apos;t forget about that stupid movie .
who gi@@ ves a fu@@ ck ?
no one could den@@ y this .
both he and I are high school students .
c@@ le@@ ar@@ ly , this is the most important point .
they &apos;re against an@@ im@@ al ab@@ use .
can you si@@ g@@ n this birthday c@@ ard ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to stop al@@ lowing her to always have her own way .
you &apos;re lucky to have such a good job .
I agree with some of your op@@ in@@ ions .
I was already married at your age .
as far as I am con@@ c@@ er@@ ned , I have no ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion .
I just got t@@ en@@ ure .
do you have any c@@ as@@ h ?
you &apos;ll b@@ oun@@ ce back .
she &apos;s my wife .
my dog won &apos;t bi@@ te you , un@@ less you ask for it .
a trip to M@@ ar@@ s may become possible in my li@@ fe@@ time .
I &apos;d tell you all you want and more , if the s@@ ounds I made could be what you hear .
take any two car@@ ds you like .
over 3@@ 00 people were ar@@ res@@ ted .
the heart and m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y of his ph@@ il@@ o@@ so@@ ph@@ y was , to look u@@ po@@ n the world as a gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic practi@@ cal jo@@ ke ; as something too ab@@ sur@@ d to be consi@@ dered ser@@ i@@ ously , by any r@@ ati@@ on@@ al man .
the pl@@ as@@ tic sur@@ g@@ e@@ on succ@@ ee@@ ded in re@@ con@@ s@@ tru@@ c@@ ting the hand of a p@@ ati@@ ent after s@@ ever@@ al long and del@@ ic@@ ate oper@@ ations .
you must ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se more care in writing English .
do you want something to eat ?
you can &apos;t buy that kind of lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
they look so cute together .
what can you teach me ?
that won &apos;t change anything .
we &apos;re done .
you need to re@@ dec@@ or@@ ate your room .
I &apos;m sure Tom will leave early .
I know you feel bad .
I have stayed in K@@ y@@ o@@ to for three days .
be fai@@ r .
a gu@@ ide con@@ du@@ c@@ ted the vis@@ it@@ ors r@@ ound the mus@@ eu@@ m .
this problem is difficult to sol@@ ve .
how do you know that you don &apos;t need a bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard ?
I couldn &apos;t b@@ ear to look at her .
the b@@ om@@ b will ex@@ pl@@ o@@ de in 1@@ 0 se@@ con@@ ds .
that is his house .
smoking har@@ ms your health .
where are you going ?
your sister called .
they saw us as they were getting off the train .
he wants to squ@@ is@@ h the bu@@ g .
I understand your feelings .
I didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
now and then your sister as@@ ks our si@@ st@@ ers to teach her something .
I don &apos;t want my son to be like you .
R@@ e@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion hel@@ ps you remember something .
when will your new no@@ v@@ el come out ?
why did you agree to help them ?
why did you do that ?
she ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed to him why she didn &apos;t like his parents .
Tom &apos;s here .
I hate go@@ at che@@ ese .
they are as strong as us .
I found the money .
she c@@ le@@ ar@@ ly wants to go .
you &apos;re w@@ im@@ ps !
what cr@@ ap ! your ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant comm@@ ents aren &apos;t just us@@ el@@ ess but also a pain in the ar@@ se .
I am thinking about bu@@ ying a new par@@ as@@ ol .
I like list@@ en@@ ing to the go@@ l@@ d@@ fin@@ ches sin@@ ging .
how about for tomorrow ?
she can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an .
I fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed the re@@ ci@@ p@@ e .
things are about to change .
stop del@@ u@@ ding yourself .
we like nobody and nobody likes us .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
be pre@@ par@@ ed .
I think that they will fol@@ low us .
I appreciate your sup@@ port .
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced himself .
I am just war@@ m@@ ing up now .
he re@@ turned home for the first time in ten years .
does it bo@@ ther you if I smoke ?
she has a piano l@@ es@@ son once a week .
it goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health .
the train was del@@ a@@ y@@ ed because of heavy s@@ no@@ w@@ f@@ all .
I hate them all .
it is very fine today .
I o@@ we you my life .
Mary is a better sw@@ im@@ mer than J@@ an@@ e .
are you really going to let Tom do that ?
he doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly , I don &apos;t like your idea .
Tom must learn French .
Mary is thir@@ st@@ y .
no @-@ one invited her .
I know something you don &apos;t .
are we m@@ ad squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s ?
the st@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty of Ch@@ in@@ ese e@@ con@@ om@@ y is sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally over@@ es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed .
I felt bad about what I did .
do you get it ?
may I ask you some more questions ?
this mo@@ v@@ ement from r@@ ur@@ al to ur@@ b@@ an ar@@ e@@ as has been going on for over two hun@@ d@@ red years .
send it to me .
you can &apos;t smoke here .
do you have a b@@ lo@@ g ?
I met her late in the evening .
when is the breakfast ser@@ ved ?
I &apos;m here with a friend .
do you want me to believe that ?
Tom was afraid of fai@@ lu@@ re .
I m@@ ess@@ ed up .
O@@ w !
she would have been very pr@@ ou@@ d of you .
I &apos;ve been w@@ al@@ king on cr@@ u@@ t@@ ches ever since I broke my fo@@ o@@ t .
this idea has never en@@ ter@@ ed my head before .
I don &apos;t understand any of this .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
the R@@ h@@ ine r@@ un@@ s between France and G@@ er@@ many .
they went to the public swimming po@@ ol .
I said that this was a meeting room , not a be@@ d@@ room !
the Earth is a big ball .
it &apos;s my turn to tell you a secret .
what are you doing , D@@ ad ?
you &apos;re living in the past .
where exactly did you go ?
why can &apos;t I see you ?
I kind of liked them .
I &apos;m glad to have this op@@ por@@ t@@ un@@ ity to speak to you .
nothing se@@ em@@ ed out of the or@@ d@@ in@@ ary .
did you ac@@ tu@@ ally see it ?
I must buy a new win@@ ter coat .
I know you &apos;re just trying to help , and I appreciate that .
the re@@ vo@@ lu@@ tion won &apos;t be so@@ b@@ er .
must I take this me@@ dic@@ ine ?
before cro@@ s@@ sing any stre@@ et , look first left , then right , and left again .
that &apos;s strange . I could have s@@ wor@@ n that I &apos;d lo@@ cked this door .
I &apos;ve been looking for you ever@@ y@@ where .
by all me@@ ans .
we miss you very much .
Sami was we@@ al@@ thy in land .
a team of par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s is standing by .
they hon@@ o@@ red me on my birthday .
just think about how you &apos;d feel in a si@@ m@@ il@@ ar situation .
do you want money ?
Tom stu@@ t@@ ters .
Tom c@@ au@@ s@@ ed quite a lot of trouble .
it &apos;s computer @-@ gener@@ ated .
he e@@ ats nothing more than fruit .
how many people can f@@ it in your car ?
squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s eat ac@@ or@@ n@@ s .
it &apos;s h@@ ec@@ tic at my place . how about we go back to your place and watch the game there ?
I over@@ slept because I stayed up late .
I like b@@ an@@ an@@ as more than ap@@ pl@@ es .
he did a pretty good job .
then the do@@ l@@ l &apos;s eyes began to sh@@ ine like two stars and it became ali@@ ve .
the det@@ ec@@ tive took down his t@@ es@@ ti@@ mon@@ y on the s@@ po@@ t .
I think you &apos;re drunk .
we are one , after all , you and I , together we su@@ f@@ f@@ er , together exist and fore@@ ver will rec@@ re@@ ate each other .
it &apos;s an ou@@ tr@@ age .
we all became sol@@ di@@ ers .
I hate these shoes .
Tom is too young to go to school .
I don &apos;t like p@@ a@@ y@@ ing t@@ a@@ x@@ es .
Tom gets up at six every morning .
you &apos;re no fun anymore .
she got him into trouble .
&quot; stop beg@@ ging for a co@@ ok@@ i@@ e , T@@ i@@ m , &quot; his mu@@ m said , &quot; R@@ em@@ em@@ b@@ er , &apos; Ch@@ il@@ dre@@ n who ask get sk@@ i@@ pped . &apos; &quot;
Tom and Mary are a mus@@ ic@@ al du@@ o .
I don &apos;t understand why people believe in g@@ ho@@ sts .
sentences can teach us a lot . and a lot more than just words .
I succ@@ ee@@ ded in getting what I wanted .
that &apos;s what I hope .
it mat@@ ters .
what kind of t@@ at@@ too do you want ?
he den@@ i@@ ed the ru@@ mo@@ r .
I have six m@@ ou@@ ths to fe@@ ed .
don &apos;t eat like a pi@@ g .
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
get that thing off of me .
there &apos;s no place like home .
Tom is e@@ as@@ y@@ going , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ standing .
I sup@@ pos@@ e you want to ask me where I &apos;ve been .
it was him that broke the window yesterday .
run as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
when were you thinking of coming back to the S@@ t@@ ates ?
the poor old man was re@@ du@@ ced to just a sk@@ el@@ et@@ on .
where &apos;s my phone ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do something like that .
the baby takes after his mother .
I was t@@ em@@ p@@ ted to call in sick .
the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ life is better in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
you have be@@ tr@@ a@@ y@@ ed us .
Tom made Mary happy .
I would also take a lot of money .
it &apos;s the ul@@ ti@@ m@@ ate test .
J@@ u@@ g@@ gl@@ ing is ac@@ tu@@ ally a lot e@@ as@@ i@@ er than it looks .
Mary knows nothing of se@@ wing or k@@ n@@ it@@ ting .
my last name is J@@ on@@ es .
that &apos;s s@@ or@@ t of nice .
he dri@@ ves a tru@@ ck .
everyone was s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing .
give me a ham@@ mer .
bir@@ ds f@@ ly long dist@@ an@@ ces .
busy as u@@ su@@ al ?
they kno@@ cked on the door and said they had come to ar@@ rest him .
I w@@ ai@@ ted for an hour , but he didn &apos;t app@@ ear .
I got up while it was still dark .
what does this pain@@ ting re@@ present ?
the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist asked me a whole b@@ at@@ ter@@ y of questions .
she left the hospital an hour ago .
I w@@ ai@@ ted for him all day long .
this was his one and only hope .
I stop@@ ped at the store and got some milk on my way back .
be nice .
he is just mus@@ ic@@ ally gi@@ f@@ ted . he m@@ as@@ ter@@ ed the gu@@ it@@ ar in one year at the age of 1@@ 5 .
the sea is very gre@@ en .
do you think something like that will re@@ pe@@ at it@@ sel@@ f ?
guess whose birthday it is today .
do you love me ?
some of these are mine .
there is a school down the mountain .
promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
who left this m@@ ess in the to@@ il@@ et ?
any clu@@ es ?
he became world @-@ famous for his dis@@ co@@ very .
you need to s@@ av@@ e the pr@@ in@@ c@@ ess .
who won today ?
ex@@ cu@@ se me . can you di@@ rec@@ t me to the ne@@ ar@@ est sub@@ way station ?
I list@@ en@@ ed to the ra@@ di@@ o while I worked .
this is your chance .
leave me alone .
I met B@@ o@@ b and Mary while I was waiting for K@@ ate .
Tom es@@ cap@@ ed .
can you do a hand@@ st@@ and ?
who does your dec@@ or@@ ating ?
that s@@ ounds like a great idea .
I was about to go out when the phone r@@ ang .
after what has happened , I d@@ are not see her again .
you &apos;re very busy .
you are to see a doctor at once .
ad@@ d the m@@ a@@ y@@ on@@ n@@ ai@@ se .
G@@ er@@ many was once al@@ li@@ ed with I@@ tal@@ y .
do your parents know about this ?
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;ll miss her a lot .
I was too tired to care for anything but bed .
he won a go@@ ld me@@ d@@ al .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with you .
both Tom and Mary smoke .
it &apos;s ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
the man is eating bre@@ ad .
he is of a hu@@ m@@ or@@ ous turn of mind .
A@@ aw@@ w ! he &apos;s so cute .
K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an is one of the d@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es in C@@ en@@ tr@@ al A@@ si@@ a .
I can &apos;t thank you enough for all your kin@@ d@@ ness .
he kept his sense of hu@@ mo@@ r until the day he died .
I need more paper for my dr@@ a@@ win@@ gs .
Tom has two legs .
I will be working on my re@@ port all day tomorrow .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
for the time being , I in@@ t@@ en@@ d to stay at a hotel .
you should go and have your hair cut .
as u@@ su@@ al , he was the last to ar@@ ri@@ ve at the the@@ at@@ er .
I know Tom is a good ac@@ tor .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
do you know how to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong ?
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
I think it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that they &apos;ll ar@@ ri@@ ve next week .
as he couldn &apos;t end@@ ure , he took to his h@@ e@@ el@@ s .
the ju@@ ry didn &apos;t buy Dan &apos;s story .
is anyone else going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already open .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ th@@ ers or si@@ st@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the coffee is too strong for me . &quot; &quot; Oh , I am sorry . per@@ h@@ ap@@ s ad@@ d a little milk . &quot;
he made a s@@ pe@@ ec@@ h in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my opinion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom hasn &apos;t re@@ ali@@ zed his mistake yet .
if you go to that su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et , you can buy most things you use in your d@@ ai@@ ly life .
let &apos;s rest a little .
there was ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tel@@ y nothing you could do about it .
do you like h@@ or@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vi@@ es ?
whose turn is it ?
do you have any advice for me ?
J@@ an@@ e is not as t@@ all as Mary .
where does J@@ o@@ h@@ n live ?
I looked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the ro@@ ad .
I think that &apos;s the best answer .
what fo@@ ods , if any , do you av@@ o@@ id eating ?
I &apos;m not as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
that ar@@ ti@@ c@@ le makes fun of v@@ e@@ g@@ et@@ ar@@ i@@ ans .
did you take the money ?
Sami reco@@ g@@ ni@@ zed the man in the p@@ ho@@ to .
we should just enjoy this and not worry about how much it co@@ sts .
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
I asked you first .
she &apos;s right behind you .
the res@@ ul@@ t was rather dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting .
Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .
by 20@@ 3@@ 0 tw@@ enty @-@ one per@@ c@@ ent of its po@@ pu@@ l@@ ation will be over si@@ x@@ ty @-@ five .
where did you hear that story ?
I learned how to use a ham@@ mer from my d@@ ad .
we lost on that job .
he has a pi@@ thy re@@ mar@@ k for every o@@ c@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on .
she wo@@ re heart @-@ sh@@ ap@@ ed ear@@ r@@ ings .
when I run , I get sw@@ e@@ at@@ y .
left @-@ wing comm@@ un@@ is@@ m is an in@@ f@@ an@@ ti@@ le dis@@ order .
I haven &apos;t yet done what you &apos;ve asked me to do .
I wash my app@@ le .
he is an ac@@ ro@@ b@@ at .
your brother is sick .
Tom shouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
he did what he promis@@ ed to do for me .
she tre@@ ated him like a king .
Tom is not crying .
tell us how to sol@@ ve the problem .
you didn &apos;t make it clear .
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
be m@@ er@@ ci@@ ful .
I spoke to him yesterday .
she &apos;s no s@@ ain@@ t .
I dre@@ am@@ ed I had been ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted by ali@@ ens .
I &apos;m in way over my head .
Tom will re@@ fu@@ se to do that .
she p@@ us@@ hed him off the pi@@ er .
I don &apos;t exp@@ ect you to understand it .
give a th@@ i@@ ef enough ro@@ p@@ e and he &apos;ll h@@ ang himself .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
Tom left his tru@@ m@@ p@@ et at school .
he arrived at mi@@ d@@ night .
this looks good .
we went on a pic@@ ni@@ c together .
you &apos;re cre@@ ep@@ y .
Tom often makes the same mist@@ akes .
I hear that Mary is very pretty .
I don &apos;t get it .
I went there times without number .
the company man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tures a v@@ ar@@ i@@ ety of paper go@@ ods .
you didn &apos;t have to finish early .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
this is Tom &apos;s shirt , not mine .
I would like to be able to join the W@@ h@@ at@@ s@@ A@@ p@@ p G@@ r@@ ou@@ p .
my doctor ad@@ vis@@ ed me to give up smoking .
I know you &apos;re still in love with me .
I can &apos;t fi@@ gu@@ re out anything .
he do@@ t@@ es on his grand@@ son .
I &apos;ve been trying to get your attention .
who was respon@@ si@@ ble ?
I am at the b@@ ank .
you seem happy .
he was a go@@ d to his people .
is this your daughter ?
I need more information on this matter .
Tom said he wanted those .
the su@@ it f@@ its well .
I live in a big city .
K@@ o@@ re@@ a rec@@ ei@@ ved an in@@ spec@@ tion from the In@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ al A@@ t@@ om@@ ic E@@ n@@ erg@@ y A@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
I &apos;m invited to a party tonight .
why didn &apos;t you tell us that ?
please change the p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ ation .
were you exc@@ ited ?
I &apos;m an@@ x@@ i@@ ous about the future .
do you like tri@@ ps ?
Tom ow@@ es Mary a lot of money .
how did you sleep last night ?
are you leaving tomorrow ?
Tom cl@@ ai@@ m@@ s to have p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ c po@@ w@@ ers .
he must be a good boy .
if you &apos;re not careful , you might have an accident .
can you des@@ cri@@ be the situation you were in ?
are those people ter@@ ro@@ ri@@ sts ?
I f@@ ed the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s to my dog .
what a to@@ t@@ al i@@ di@@ o@@ t !
he lived to be s@@ ev@@ enty years old .
you are free tomorrow .
I was off du@@ ty at the time .
the man never told the police what his des@@ t@@ in@@ ation was .
these are my d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters .
she slept off her h@@ ang@@ over .
I &apos;m not used to getting up early .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m not getting fi@@ red .
I can look into this for you .
tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic li@@ ghts work all the time .
don &apos;t read this sentence .
please don &apos;t go home .
win@@ ter is snow time .
she has the cl@@ ap .
you should keep your promis@@ es .
I didn &apos;t say it happened here .
so ? feeling re@@ f@@ r@@ es@@ hed , the morning after gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ating from vi@@ r@@ g@@ in@@ ity ?
how do you plan on p@@ a@@ y@@ ing for that ?
we &apos;re through .
he was too young to go to school .
which fo@@ ods are rich in c@@ al@@ ori@@ es and which aren &apos;t ?
wait a se@@ c .
the si@@ st@@ ers are both bl@@ on@@ d@@ es .
I &apos;ve won .
she was very ne@@ ar@@ ly run over by a tru@@ ck .
we &apos;ve been working on this problem all w@@ ee@@ k@@ end .
you make it look easy .
they &apos;re bro@@ th@@ ers .
I know Tom is a me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic .
my Ch@@ in@@ ese is ter@@ ri@@ ble .
I need someone who I can talk to .
the boy &apos;s ag@@ g@@ res@@ sion is making problems .
I don &apos;t go in for that s@@ or@@ t of thing .
the bo@@ ss doesn &apos;t know it yet .
they walked together .
I bought her a new car .
they un@@ w@@ r@@ app@@ ed their s@@ and@@ wi@@ ches .
ev@@ en@@ tu@@ ally it was possible to find a really s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ ory so@@ lu@@ tion .
he didn &apos;t look happy .
I &apos;ll ride sho@@ t@@ g@@ u@@ n .
I have a bo@@ y@@ friend who lo@@ ves me .
health is ab@@ o@@ ve we@@ al@@ th ; the l@@ at@@ ter gi@@ ves less for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ e than the for@@ mer .
your re@@ qu@@ est has been den@@ i@@ ed because you have no v@@ ali@@ d res@@ id@@ enti@@ al address .
I did not lose my mind , I so@@ ld it on e@@ B@@ ay .
he is always a st@@ ep or two a@@ head of the times .
I can &apos;t see it .
here &apos;s the address .
I don &apos;t feel much like talking .
the two car@@ s col@@ li@@ ded at the inter@@ s@@ ec@@ tion .
C@@ om@@ p@@ as@@ sion is the bas@@ is of all m@@ or@@ al@@ ity .
go and help wash the di@@ sh@@ es .
we need to find out who he is and who he &apos;s working for .

Dan had no m@@ em@@ ory of what he had done .
the C@@ ath@@ ar@@ es in sou@@ th@@ er@@ n France were called Al@@ bi@@ gen@@ si@@ ans .

I know where you hi@@ de your di@@ ary .
Tom said he had more important things to do .
B@@ re@@ and@@ รก@@ n is a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
what &apos;s Tom good at ?
everything was difficult .
no one re@@ ad@@ s my b@@ lo@@ g .
by the time he fin@@ ds out , it will be too late .
how did you lose it ?
she called him every other day .
he was late because of the snow .
she said she had been happy .
how long will this go on ?
I think we &apos;re even .
I gave it my best shot .
my doctor thinks it &apos;s c@@ an@@ c@@ er@@ ous but told me to feel free to get a second opinion .
the cu@@ st@@ om@@ s office is at the bor@@ der .
we took tu@@ r@@ n@@ s with the dri@@ ving .

who would better his st@@ ate should look to his f@@ oun@@ d@@ ations .
the contr@@ act was end@@ ed .

Tom ri@@ s@@ ked his life for us .
I &apos;m not sure what to say .
it &apos;s the same here .
the cost of building the new hospital was consi@@ der@@ ab@@ ly high@@ er than first es@@ ti@@ mat@@ ed .
I saw him kis@@ sing another girl .
which sk@@ ir@@ t do you like ?
I don &apos;t drink .
don &apos;t you think I know my own husband ?
in h@@ in@@ d@@ si@@ ght , this was a mistake .
I think Tom did a really nice job .
have you put on sun@@ s@@ cre@@ en ?
you &apos;re late .
are you students ?
I couldn &apos;t lie to you .
how much will this cost ?
what am I up against ?
Sami re@@ f@@ used to get invol@@ ved .

don &apos;t d@@ well too much u@@ po@@ n the sub@@ ject .
nobody can con@@ tro@@ l us .
I didn &apos;t want to in@@ su@@ l@@ t you .
where is his house ?
he had no friend to help him .
man is never perf@@ ect , no@@ r con@@ t@@ ent .
we were par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .

he be@@ tr@@ a@@ y@@ ed you .
Tom likes ar@@ i@@ th@@ me@@ tic .
I had no idea this br@@ ac@@ el@@ et was sto@@ l@@ en .
if each gener@@ ation die and leave g@@ ho@@ sts the world at last will get over@@ cro@@ w@@ ded with them .
no one here will be@@ tr@@ ay you .
I was d@@ em@@ and@@ ing .
this child sol@@ ved the comp@@ lic@@ ated ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ c@@ s problem easily .
Tom told Mary he had to talk to her .
Japanese women get married at 2@@ 5 on av@@ er@@ age .
her hair is long and beautiful .
does it matter to you ?
everyone knew .
j@@ ack is b@@ ound to succ@@ e@@ ed this time .
I &apos;m ready for tomorrow .
do your best and don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ve been fol@@ lowing you .

Tom had every right to be angry .
he pain@@ ted the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing b@@ lu@@ e .
the meeting will have finished by the time we get there .
he got into bed .
how long was she un@@ der@@ water ?
my con@@ c@@ er@@ n is the future .
why are they doing this ?
he pass@@ ed away .
L@@ ets play vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es or something .
he t@@ au@@ ght me how to write .
the plan@@ e arrived exactly at n@@ ine .
Layla never w@@ ear@@ s ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p .
do you write in French ?
she clu@@ t@@ ched her baby in her ar@@ ms .
I have to study for tomorrow &apos;s French test .
it seems that the only time he isn &apos;t eating is when he &apos;s sleeping .
T@@ hom@@ as sli@@ d his hands behind his back to un@@ cl@@ as@@ p his br@@ a .
he pro@@ o@@ f@@ read my man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ t .
be al@@ er@@ t !
Tom asked Mary where she lived .
the world began without man and it shall end without him .
P@@ au@@ l tal@@ ks a lot .
I had a light lunch .
what have you been thinking about for so long ?
I couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
have you started reading the book yet ?
her pass@@ ing the ex@@ am is a sure thing .
my father has a restaurant .
I was ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly wor@@ ried .
Tom w@@ ai@@ ted for Mary for three hours .
what is it you want me to do ?
why are they leaving ?
one of the hun@@ ters was shot and had to be taken to hospital , where he is now making a s@@ pe@@ e@@ d@@ y reco@@ very .
in the s@@ pr@@ ing , when the days gre@@ w longer and the sun war@@ mer , she w@@ ai@@ ted for the first ro@@ b@@ in to re@@ turn from the sou@@ th .
he always ar@@ ri@@ v@@ es on time .
let &apos;s see if that works .
do you remember me ?
she needs help .
is he still interested ?
I &apos;m not sure what I want to do .
he ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ated S@@ t@@ ate C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ m over M@@ ar@@ k@@ et C@@ ap@@ it@@ al@@ is@@ m .
the real her@@ o@@ es are us .
you &apos;re safe .
English is a g@@ lo@@ b@@ al language .
you &apos;re C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an , right ?
In@@ di@@ a is po@@ pu@@ l@@ ous .
we wonder why .
Tom has decided to put off his de@@ par@@ ture .
just remember to have fun .
E@@ s@@ per@@ an@@ to is written ph@@ on@@ e@@ ti@@ c@@ ally with an al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et of 2@@ 8 let@@ ters .
can I pay later ?
take away this box .
I will do anything for you .
I &apos;m strong enough .
how do I get to ... ?
it &apos;s not what he said , but the way he said it .
they r@@ ent@@ ed a house .
I can probably do that .
these pic@@ tures were pain@@ ted by him .
it is out of the question .
please re@@ mind me to pos@@ t the letter .
maybe she can tell you more .
I have the keys .
I &apos;m only doing this for your own good .
I &apos;m em@@ o@@ ti@@ on@@ ally dr@@ ain@@ ed .

did you stop at the red tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic light ?
which book do you need ?
it &apos;s dangerous to swim in this river .
what does this have to do with school ?
he turned p@@ ale when he heard that news .
A@@ m@@ n@@ es@@ ty In@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ on@@ al cl@@ ai@@ m@@ s that F@@ ac@@ e@@ book and G@@ o@@ o@@ g@@ le ab@@ use hu@@ man ri@@ ghts because of over@@ ly ag@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ ve co@@ ll@@ ec@@ tion of us@@ er d@@ at@@ a .
Tom works at M@@ acc@@ a &apos;s .
is that so bad ?
watch your st@@ ep in dark al@@ le@@ ys .
W@@ ill@@ in@@ g@@ n@@ ess to correct is an in@@ dic@@ ation of w@@ is@@ d@@ om .
while you &apos;re young , you should read a lot .
Tom isn &apos;t dead .
take the gar@@ b@@ age out .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
no d@@ ou@@ b@@ t .
let &apos;s call it a day .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . I guess I have the wrong number .
they hur@@ ried to the s@@ cen@@ e of the accident .
the door opened .
there is a b@@ ank in f@@ r@@ on@@ t of the station .
he cut the ro@@ p@@ e with his te@@ et@@ h .
Tom became a doctor .
in the first place , you should be p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
I have feeling in my legs .
I can touch the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing .
it &apos;s a matter of either @-@ or .
no , he didn &apos;t .

my grand@@ mother lives in the country .

our best friend is a doctor .

my te@@ et@@ h hurt .
the boys were as n@@ er@@ v@@ ous as the girls .
it was the only way .

what &apos;s your favorite sub@@ ject ?
his sentence was re@@ du@@ ced because there were mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ating ci@@ r@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ ces .
you &apos;re probably too young to understand what &apos;s happen@@ ing .
we &apos;re not interested .

I always ar@@ ri@@ ve a little a@@ head of time .
one hun@@ d@@ red do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s will co@@ ver all your ex@@ pen@@ ses for the trip .
I &apos;ve always p@@ aid the r@@ ent .
Mr J@@ o@@ h@@ n@@ son &apos;s was a large room .
that &apos;s the reason we &apos;re here .
Tom could &apos;ve talked to me .
free f@@ low of information is the only s@@ a@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard against t@@ y@@ r@@ an@@ ny .
could you stay and help me ?
there isn &apos;t much snow on the gr@@ ound .
I &apos;d like to ask one or two questions myself .
I shall try to take the ball without him no@@ ti@@ c@@ ing .
she wh@@ i@@ pped out her pi@@ sto@@ l .

what you need is , in a word , p@@ ati@@ ence .
we didn &apos;t find a wea@@ po@@ n .

anybody can parti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
nobody likes him .
she &apos;d like him to leave right away .
you will always be w@@ el@@ come .
it cost a lot more than I thought it would .
I told the news to everyone I met .
given such a situation what else could I do ?
you know you &apos;ve hit the big time when you get par@@ o@@ died on T@@ he S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ ons .
never tell the truth when a lie will do .
I thought I told you never to call me .
hel@@ l@@ o . this is J@@ o@@ e C@@ ar@@ l@@ t@@ on . may I speak to M@@ i@@ ch@@ a@@ el ?
I hope to get away from T@@ ok@@ y@@ o for a few days .
even im@@ parti@@ al@@ ity is parti@@ al .
she looked stu@@ pe@@ fi@@ ed in am@@ az@@ ement .
F@@ ad@@ il told me nothing .

I was careful to not leave any ev@@ id@@ ence .
they went sur@@ f@@ ing .

I haven &apos;t heard from Tom in a year .
what do you want to eat this w@@ ee@@ k@@ end ?
I fell .

I &apos;m already re@@ tired .
he is reading a book . let &apos;s leave him alone .
why are you looking at me ?
I &apos;m so sick of this .
Japan is here !
he turned around .
I still don &apos;t know what that is .

there are some good m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ages , but there are no del@@ ici@@ ous on@@ es .
I could &apos;ve married Tom .
the teacher asked me a difficult question .
I already told you he isn &apos;t here .
are you ready to leave ?
I may have to work part time .
who knew about this ?
this ser@@ ies of books com@@ pri@@ ses for@@ ty @-@ ei@@ ght vo@@ lu@@ m@@ es .
he hel@@ d a pen in his hands .
I me@@ ant no off@@ en@@ se .
he was s@@ l@@ ain in b@@ att@@ le .
it &apos;s there someone you can tr@@ us@@ t ?
keep these ru@@ les in mind .
Tom is l@@ ying in bed with a cold .
bir@@ ds sing .
I heard that she came here .
don &apos;t lose heart now .
you &apos;re very wi@@ se .
look at the girls .
Tom and J@@ an@@ e got married last month .
doesn &apos;t that st@@ ri@@ ke you as o@@ d@@ d ?
be min@@ d@@ ful of that v@@ it@@ am@@ in A can be to@@ x@@ ic at high@@ er l@@ ev@@ el@@ s .
pro@@ ve it to me .
please put a lot of cre@@ am in my coffee .
why didn &apos;t you come to the party ?
T@@ r@@ ang , when are you going to up@@ date Tatoeba ?
you &apos;re a cute girl .
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you .
father , for@@ give them ; for they know not what they do .
he had no idea what to exp@@ ect .
I &apos;d like you to meet a friend of mine .
what a great idea !
come back tomorrow .
we have nothing in com@@ m@@ on .
the bu@@ ds began to bur@@ st .
I have to go up@@ stairs .
Dan shot M@@ at@@ t in sel@@ f @-@ de@@ f@@ ence .
forget it !
Tom was in love with M@@ ar@@ ia , but she didn &apos;t want to know anything about him .
the man died a few hours ago .
I ad@@ mi@@ re Tom &apos;s per@@ s@@ ever@@ ance .
she has a thing for ol@@ der men .
everything &apos;s going to work out .
the T@@ ic@@ k@@ D@@ is@@ play fun@@ c@@ tion has to be called every f@@ r@@ ame in order to play the an@@ im@@ ation .
the se@@ ar@@ ch for ali@@ en life is one of hu@@ man@@ kind &apos;s gre@@ at@@ est te@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ ic@@ al ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es .
the past is no longer and the future is not yet .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ve off@@ end@@ ed you .
Mary thinks that O@@ li@@ v@@ er is sp@@ end@@ ing too much time playing vi@@ de@@ o@@ g@@ am@@ es .
I &apos;ve done that coun@@ t@@ less times .
you guys are aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
we know that you &apos;re sick .
I &apos;d take it if I were you .
did you go to the restaurant yesterday ?
she found him standing near the en@@ tr@@ ance .
put the car into the gar@@ age .
I exp@@ ect you to be p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
what was the first con@@ c@@ er@@ t you went to ?
has Tom been fi@@ red ?
he mo@@ ves quickly .
the baby fell as@@ le@@ ep in the cr@@ ad@@ le .
we looked around the pro@@ per@@ ty .
I can ho@@ ld my bre@@ at@@ h for a long time .
that &apos;s another matter .
we haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
this is something I must face alone .
what do I me@@ an to you ?
I su@@ gg@@ est you co@@ oper@@ ate .
we were me@@ di@@ o@@ c@@ re .
m@@ ea@@ sure t@@ wi@@ ce , cut once .
I didn &apos;t take the time to do it pro@@ per@@ ly .
that &apos;s a really great idea .
time is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than anything else .
where are they swimming ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m talking to you about this .
M@@ et@@ e@@ or@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts are people who know a t@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ous am@@ oun@@ t about g@@ e@@ op@@ h@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ s , th@@ er@@ mo@@ d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic@@ s and c@@ li@@ mat@@ o@@ log@@ y , and almost nothing about tomorrow &apos;s weather .
we have to find a way to get that done .
I fol@@ ded the to@@ w@@ el@@ s .
I have low b@@ lo@@ od pres@@ sure .
he sometimes comes to see me .
I told you not to come here .
what are you going to have ?
I was ev@@ en@@ tu@@ ally rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed .
I have to go to bed .
your room number , please .
I found my bicycle gone .
I feel safe here .
we con@@ c@@ en@@ tr@@ ated .
make yourself com@@ for@@ table .
this is a happy o@@ c@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on .
take it as it comes .
do you feel lucky ?
are there any cute girls in your class ?
it is now that it be@@ comes interesting .
Tom has decided to have the sur@@ ger@@ y that his doctor re@@ comm@@ end@@ ed .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
E@@ ri@@ c is on our so@@ c@@ c@@ er team .
when i@@ ce m@@ el@@ ts , it be@@ comes li@@ qu@@ i@@ d .
Tom was m@@ au@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .
we sw@@ am in the sea .
he slept until ten o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ clo@@ ck .
the Earth is just a little is@@ land and we are little is@@ l@@ and@@ ers .
she is a good li@@ ar .
I am not busy .
why don &apos;t we all go ?
let me put this in per@@ spec@@ tive for you .
nobody des@@ er@@ ves that .
I want to speak to my la@@ w@@ y@@ er now .
can you tell us how that &apos;ll work ?
I love my y@@ el@@ low sw@@ e@@ at@@ er .
you shall have a bicycle for your birthday .
she made it plain that she wanted to go to col@@ le@@ ge .
I was a sh@@ y child .
I sup@@ pos@@ e it makes sense to go a@@ head and pay the bill right now .
he is as@@ ham@@ ed to ask questions .
I can &apos;t turn it on , because the sw@@ it@@ ch is broken .
these clothes are di@@ r@@ ty and need to be was@@ hed .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll leave early .
they &apos;re reading a book .
Al@@ f@@ red , K@@ ing of E@@ n@@ gl@@ and , was a great s@@ cho@@ l@@ ar as well as a great ru@@ l@@ er .
you need to sleep .
&quot; Oh ! they &apos;ll find him gu@@ il@@ ty , &quot; said the other . &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of that . &quot;
I am lost .
he is getting better .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
ever@@ y@@ day life can get a bit mon@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ ous at times .
was V@@ en@@ us , a des@@ er@@ t plan@@ et with th@@ ic@@ k cl@@ ou@@ ds of su@@ l@@ fu@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id , fore@@ telling the future of Earth ?
where did you have your su@@ it made ?
I am not c@@ er@@ t@@ ain about that .
while he was sick , he lost a lot of we@@ ight .
I &apos;ll bring wine .
do f@@ er@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ers con@@ t@@ ain p@@ ho@@ sp@@ h@@ or@@ us ?
have you already eaten sup@@ per ?
the sun is about to ri@@ se .
it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al to park a car there .
do you know how to read a ma@@ p ?
I thought I had until 2 : 3@@ 0 .
I like mat@@ h least of all .
that has nothing to do with him .
we call him M@@ i@@ ke .
how did you get into our room ?
everybody had a hard time .
I &apos;d like some sugar , please .
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to w@@ ear glasses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay attention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
he is a true co@@ lo@@ s@@ su@@ s .
I may know someone who can help you .
here we are .
the so@@ ci@@ ety in which they live is very different from our own .
she wrote a lot of po@@ em@@ s .
I want to talk to you .
he was born in R@@ o@@ me .
how did you become invol@@ ved in this pro@@ ject ?
either you or I must go in his place .
with all his f@@ au@@ l@@ ts , he is res@@ p@@ ected by everybody .
what a tr@@ ag@@ e@@ d@@ y !
Tom har@@ dly ever w@@ ear@@ s a ti@@ e .
I pain@@ ted a picture for you .
he likes to talk about himself .
there was a kno@@ ck on the door .
how did you know that man was a co@@ p ?
how did you get into my house ?
I &apos;m not a great p@@ ho@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ her .
it &apos;s like one of those .
she s@@ cr@@ u@@ b@@ bed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en floor with a br@@ ush .
those do@@ ors should be closed .
what would you do in my place ?
I go to any party I am invited to .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in a year - s@@ pr@@ ing , summer , f@@ all , and win@@ ter .
I want to help you get out of this m@@ ess .
Sami was already on the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter .
get mo@@ ving !
I must be leaving now .
she was app@@ re@@ ci@@ ab@@ ly t@@ an@@ ned after her v@@ ac@@ ation .
the wo@@ od was very dark , and she could not help t@@ re@@ m@@ bl@@ ing from f@@ ear .
the g@@ e@@ y@@ s@@ er s@@ ends up a co@@ lu@@ m@@ n of hot water every two hours .
the eg@@ gs are still hot .
an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake of m@@ ag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de 5 sho@@ o@@ k T@@ ok@@ y@@ o .
this river r@@ un@@ s through my v@@ ill@@ age .
I like h@@ ang@@ ing out here .
I want Tom to take a look at that .
do you think he will like that ?
j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce in this country is a bit of a d@@ ou@@ ble st@@ and@@ ard : there is the j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce of the poor and the j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce of the rich .
I don &apos;t eat out very often .
&quot; let &apos;s play H@@ o@@ p S@@ k@@ i@@ p An@@ d J@@ u@@ m@@ p like me , &quot; said the little wh@@ ite r@@ ab@@ bit .
I wonder what all of them have in com@@ m@@ on .
what was the c@@ au@@ se of the ex@@ pl@@ o@@ sion ?
I &apos;ll get my keys .
let me go !
may I in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself ?
left @-@ hand th@@ re@@ ad@@ s have now become un@@ su@@ al in me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic@@ s but they can still be found on some ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ts , such as on b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ les &apos; pe@@ d@@ als , for in@@ st@@ ance .
the B@@ B@@ C is my fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ te ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l .
I p@@ aid two hun@@ d@@ red do@@ ll@@ ar@@ s in t@@ a@@ x@@ es .
con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations , and th@@ an@@ ks for everything !
he t@@ ends to be ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant .
we remember .
it is free of char@@ ge .
will he succ@@ e@@ ed or fai@@ l ?
I just don &apos;t like it .
J@@ u@@ d@@ ging from his appe@@ ar@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to a@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have pl@@ enty of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m making an ap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment for my daughter .
he succ@@ ee@@ ded to his un@@ c@@ le &apos;s for@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ e .
Dan didn &apos;t know where his car key was .
I miss you all the time .
you are a tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er .
will you go to the dance with me ?
it &apos;s expensive to mo@@ der@@ ni@@ ze a city .
what is the name of that bir@@ d ?
you &apos;re invited .
I &apos;m talking with R@@ o@@ c@@ รญ@@ o .
let me see .
women often pain@@ t their fin@@ ger@@ n@@ ails .
they &apos;re not a thre@@ at .
Tom won &apos;t believe it .
that gu@@ y &apos;s a friend of mine .
Australi@@ a is about tw@@ enty times l@@ ar@@ ger than Japan .
she cut the cake in two .
you hand@@ led that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his succ@@ ess .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I sup@@ pos@@ e you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to sit on the b@@ en@@ ch over there next to the stre@@ et l@@ am@@ p .
An@@ t@@ ar@@ es is a red st@@ ar .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I have a friend in S@@ pain who speaks five languages .
is today your birthday ?
let &apos;s go to P@@ au@@ l &apos;s D@@ in@@ er .
you ought to be qu@@ i@@ et in a library .
Tom fell as@@ le@@ ep waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only sli@@ gh@@ tly sm@@ aller than the Earth and M@@ ar@@ s is bi@@ g@@ ger than half of Earth .
do you find that was@@ hing ma@@ ch@@ ine easy to use ?
she comm@@ itted a cri@@ me .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ war@@ ds them .
it is easy to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ h good from ev@@ il .
how is your d@@ ad ?
bring them to me .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak L@@ o@@ j@@ b@@ an .
Tom drin@@ ks at least three li@@ ters of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the th@@ r@@ ush sin@@ gs each s@@ ong t@@ wi@@ ce over .
do you know if he is av@@ ai@@ l@@ able ? I need to know in order to make an ap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment with him .
don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ v@@ al on pri@@ ce .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Ch@@ in@@ ese .
have you been told the re@@ as@@ ons why we didn &apos;t hi@@ re you ?
do you watch tel@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ on ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very com@@ for@@ table .
the cri@@ min@@ al is sure to do time for ro@@ b@@ b@@ ing the store .
my children are hungry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is hon@@ est .
her b@@ el@@ i@@ ef in God is very f@@ ir@@ m .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ts d@@ ai@@ ly experience .
Tom began to shi@@ ver vi@@ ol@@ ently .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he fai@@ led .
he should get to your house in an hour .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you forgot to practi@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess it is light out .
I didn &apos;t mo@@ ve a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many w@@ ays , these fo@@ s@@ s@@ il@@ s are the &apos; smoking g@@ u@@ n &apos; just before the em@@ erg@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
how far do we have to go ?
children g@@ row very quickly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ c@@ s , being after all a pro@@ du@@ c@@ t of hu@@ man thought in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent of experience , is so ad@@ mi@@ r@@ ab@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ ted to the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ts of re@@ al@@ ity ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .
which co@@ lo@@ r do you prefer , b@@ lu@@ e or gre@@ en ?
the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es c@@ er@@ em@@ on@@ i@@ ously cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the tri@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ h of n@@ ati@@ on@@ al@@ is@@ m , do@@ ping and com@@ m@@ er@@ ce .
in the v@@ al@@ le@@ y , the vi@@ o@@ let@@ s came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ land .
her sk@@ in was almost trans@@ lu@@ c@@ ent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is smart .
let us sing a s@@ ong .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ine lo@@ gi@@ c is not always log@@ ic@@ al .
when we started out , our b@@ and could only find small clu@@ b@@ s in small ci@@ ties that would hi@@ re us .
you should res@@ p@@ ect the ru@@ les your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next w@@ ee@@ k@@ end .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw Layla hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll l@@ end it to you .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
qu@@ it talking , will you ?
they set out for N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
I des@@ pi@@ se them .
my cat slept next to me .
for@@ give me .
the floor is co@@ ver@@ ed with a th@@ ic@@ k car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ ar@@ m not far from Boston .
an an@@ im@@ al can be much more dangerous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you drive a sti@@ ck shi@@ f@@ t ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
Dan par@@ ked the r@@ ent@@ al car near the police station .
where do you want to go for our first l@@ es@@ son ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom w@@ on@@ dered why Mary had stayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting more Japanese sp@@ ea@@ k@@ ers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ ounds to his am@@ bi@@ tion .
P@@ in@@ ea@@ p@@ p@@ le is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be h@@ ear@@ t@@ broken .
how did it come about ?
whose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this movie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lucky to be ali@@ ve .
you can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the l@@ ake , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
gi@@ ving up smoking is the e@@ as@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of times .
the dog is thir@@ st@@ y .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been pr@@ om@@ o@@ ted to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you me@@ an , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fi@@ ght .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ ang@@ er .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mist@@ a@@ ken as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she loved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I pl@@ ea@@ ded not gu@@ il@@ ty .
we can &apos;t pos@@ t@@ po@@ n@@ e the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invited .
long live the ger@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the piano .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but rather out of ab@@ s@@ ent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to str@@ ang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ l@@ ec@@ tion for be@@ ef .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be crazy to believe such n@@ on@@ sense .
I want you to be qu@@ i@@ et .
C@@ o@@ tt@@ on ab@@ s@@ or@@ b@@ s water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on Sun@@ day .
you guys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to cook for us ?
what language were they speaking ?
never tell lies .
both al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves are possible .
maybe I should also ad@@ d sentences without trans@@ l@@ ations ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the po@@ pu@@ l@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to b@@ et on that ?
we made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve cho@@ s@@ en her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kis@@ s you the way you want to be kis@@ sed .
stop t@@ wi@@ st@@ ing my ar@@ m !
if he s@@ ends me any let@@ ters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .
I was war@@ ned .
so@@ on@@ er or later , Tom will li@@ k@@ ely agree to help us .
this is longer than any other bri@@ dge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher ex@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing ?
we &apos;d like se@@ par@@ ate ch@@ ec@@ ks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cro@@ s@@ sing the bor@@ der .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re war@@ m enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors are . our p@@ ap@@ ers got lost du@@ ring the F@@ lo@@ od .
sit down and sh@@ u@@ t up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the m@@ en@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et .
D@@ ro@@ pl@@ ets are fall@@ ing on my l@@ ap@@ top computer .
I am sure .
I believe him to be in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a m@@ em@@ b@@ er .
this kind of work makes me hungry .
smoking is bad for your health .
In@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f to@@ s@@ sing is an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c s@@ port !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your promis@@ es .
I just want to be perf@@ ect .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to en@@ vi@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al ch@@ ang@@ es .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to Americ@@ a .
I don &apos;t have much inter@@ est in co@@ o@@ king .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ g@@ e@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ m@@ b@@ er than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your team .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a fi@@ ght with me ?
his kin@@ d@@ ness tou@@ ched my heart .
he stu@@ di@@ es bi@@ o@@ log@@ y very hard .
my un@@ c@@ le is rich .
to be perf@@ ect she l@@ acked just one de@@ f@@ ect .
I hear him fall@@ ing .
you don &apos;t have to be a vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m .
which way is the b@@ each ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more ri@@ ce , please ?
don &apos;t talk ru@@ b@@ b@@ is@@ h !
Sami lived very close to the lo@@ c@@ ation where Layla &apos;s body was found .
the su@@ sp@@ ect is a c@@ au@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ an f@@ em@@ ale .
he pain@@ ted a dog .
where did you hi@@ de the food ?
I get ch@@ app@@ ed li@@ ps every win@@ ter .
they dec@@ ei@@ ved us .
my fe@@ et are cold .
Mary accep@@ ted everything without compl@@ ain@@ ing .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our es@@ cap@@ e was nothing short of a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ed .
this glass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to cho@@ o@@ se .
my dog has c@@ anc@@ er .
do you remember the day this picture was taken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the test .
can I speak to you a moment ?
they sto@@ od on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your favorite sk@@ in care pro@@ du@@ c@@ t ?
you can b@@ or@@ row three books at a time .
I &apos;m in ab@@ so@@ lu@@ tel@@ y to@@ t@@ al ag@@ re@@ ement .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody needs to know this .
f@@ all is late this year .
they &apos;re on good ter@@ ms with their neigh@@ b@@ ors .
I &apos;m using a new computer .
Mary always stu@@ di@@ es for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a ru@@ le .
who are you clo@@ s@@ est to in your family ?
you &apos;re wor@@ se than Tom .
do the G@@ er@@ m@@ ans have any other con@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ s in life a@@ part from con@@ su@@ m@@ er@@ is@@ m ?
you should not res@@ p@@ ect a man because he is rich .
the ch@@ air cre@@ a@@ ked as he s@@ at down .
he ex@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed his b@@ el@@ i@@ ef in her hon@@ es@@ ty .
only they th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves understand what they say .
no , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was crying for her mother .
they ru@@ in@@ ed it .
they want p@@ ea@@ ce .
are we being char@@ g@@ ed with something ?
I really hate d@@ ai@@ ry pro@@ du@@ c@@ ts .
I was right on the s@@ po@@ t when it happened .
be p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
I am f@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ en years old .
you look so p@@ ale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ v@@ ar@@ k is a me@@ di@@ u@@ m @-@ si@@ zed an@@ im@@ al .
the school ru@@ les re@@ qu@@ i@@ re students to w@@ ear school un@@ i@@ for@@ m@@ s .
where can I buy books ?
I have two eyes .
I &apos;ve re@@ mo@@ ved the com@@ m@@ a .
do you have an ex@@ tr@@ a key ?
his bad le@@ g pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ed him from win@@ ning the ra@@ ce .
you &apos;re being par@@ an@@ o@@ id .
I &apos;m lucky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I ad@@ mi@@ re her e@@ f@@ f@@ or@@ ts .
we can &apos;t get close to the en@@ em@@ y .
there are a lot of stars l@@ ar@@ ger than our own S@@ u@@ n .
they aren &apos;t du@@ m@@ b@@ er than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to n@@ or@@ m@@ al ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good cook .
are you watching the pres@@ id@@ enti@@ al de@@ b@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .
who sp@@ read these ru@@ m@@ ou@@ r@@ s ?
that was written by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ ag@@ aw@@ a .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you consi@@ dered me a close friend .
things will only get wor@@ se .
the girl is drin@@ king te@@ a .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your f@@ au@@ l@@ t .
she met him on the b@@ each .
they arrived at the hotel .
is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had go@@ tt@@ en no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ p@@ ping off du@@ ring the meeting .
haven &apos;t you eaten yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about reli@@ gi@@ on .
who is there ?
he is str@@ on@@ ger than me .
I sw@@ o@@ re I &apos;d never do that .
the dog came running to me .
Tom is th@@ ro@@ wing st@@ on@@ es at bir@@ ds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ach .
she died last night .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child l@@ ab@@ or .
death before di@@ sh@@ on@@ or !
I o@@ il@@ ed my bicycle .
turn around .
this is not necessary .
we want re@@ v@@ en@@ ge .
put on your shoes . let &apos;s go out for dinner .
you &apos;re fai@@ th@@ ful .
the train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
this show is stupid .
write Spanish .
don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it s@@ no@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not writing about you .
your question is not rel@@ ev@@ ant to the sub@@ ject .
she came to see me .
this ch@@ air is too small .
how much time do you ac@@ tu@@ ally spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the do@@ ors of per@@ c@@ ep@@ tion were c@@ le@@ an@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
beer is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the por@@ ter for car@@ r@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great th@@ in@@ k@@ ers who were un@@ known while ali@@ ve became famous after death .
you &apos;re a ter@@ ri@@ ble person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the s@@ pu@@ r of the moment .
in N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are gener@@ ally sil@@ ent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat c@@ and@@ y just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some inside information about the company &apos;s pl@@ ans to go public .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no so@@ on@@ er had he seen it than he turned p@@ ale .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I appreciate the s@@ enti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
finish drin@@ king your milk .
the old man died from hun@@ ger .
20@@ 1@@ 6 is coming to an end and a new year is about to beg@@ in !
you &apos;re the ol@@ d@@ est .
I slept for ei@@ ght hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like music ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I or@@ dered .
this is such a was@@ te of time .
Tom is always playing vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es .
I have been to the store before .
stop s@@ end@@ ing me flowers .
please un@@ dress from the w@@ ai@@ st up .
that &apos;s a stupid question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ st@@ er your pro@@ du@@ c@@ t ?
Dan had to dec@@ ide wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ h@@ e@@ al@@ thy .
there is a tel@@ ev@@ is@@ i@@ on in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to clean the house .
I haven &apos;t used An@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds du@@ e .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had g@@ ath@@ ered outside the c@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the c@@ ap off this bo@@ tt@@ le .
I reco@@ g@@ ni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
Al@@ th@@ ou@@ g@@ h Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is con@@ t@@ en@@ ted .
I was bo@@ red .
if I were h@@ e@@ al@@ thy , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thir@@ st@@ y .
have fun with that .
there is something tr@@ op@@ ic@@ al and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which for@@ m@@ s a sin@@ gu@@ l@@ ar contr@@ as@@ t to her co@@ ol and un@@ em@@ o@@ ti@@ on@@ al brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would listen to me .
I can &apos;t pro@@ ve it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ v@@ el I can b@@ or@@ row ?
you have changed since I saw you last year .
e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e , catch a ti@@ ger by his to@@ e , if he ho@@ ll@@ ers let him go , e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to catch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stupid ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shirt .
it &apos;s easy to have a clear con@@ s@@ ci@@ ence when it &apos;s not used .
are you v@@ e@@ g@@ et@@ ar@@ i@@ an ?
if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ k@@ ers are against the new plan .
they stayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to s@@ or@@ t this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s strong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .
are you b@@ lowing me off ?
I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher con@@ f@@ is@@ c@@ ated a student &apos;s phone because he was t@@ ex@@ ting in class .
J@@ i@@ m hasn &apos;t come yet .
do you want something cold to drink ?
P@@ re@@ hi@@ sto@@ ri@@ c men were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .
we should h@@ ang out .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I didn &apos;t hear a s@@ pl@@ as@@ h .
I don &apos;t mind l@@ end@@ ing you the money pro@@ vi@@ ded you pay it back wi@@ th@@ in a month .
A@@ h ... ok@@ ay , I was young , but what a stupid mistake !
in fact , I should thank you for this .
I was ar@@ res@@ ted on the s@@ po@@ t .
I &apos;m studying art at school .
that never was an is@@ su@@ e .
you should really l@@ ay off that . it &apos;ll ru@@ in your health .
the me@@ dic@@ ine had no e@@ f@@ f@@ ect .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ k@@ es .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a ser@@ ies of tu@@ b@@ es .
Tom is here s@@ om@@ e@@ where .
Tom sto@@ od very close to Mary .
he re@@ m@@ ain@@ ed sil@@ ent the whole time .
Tom &apos;s French pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thinks it is .
will they el@@ ect him for four more years ?
I got up too early .
since it rain@@ ed , I stayed home .
Tom put a st@@ ar on top of the Christmas tree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I w@@ ake up at 7 o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ clo@@ ck .
they have a plan .
Tom did a good job .
Tom never said he wanted to go with us .
do you want some sugar in your coffee ?
are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
we &apos;re under att@@ ack !
it &apos;s very late .
the whole v@@ ill@@ age knows the man well .
are you up for it ?
bi@@ te the bu@@ ll@@ et .
I went to bed at tw@@ el@@ ve last night .
the e@@ f@@ f@@ ect was im@@ me@@ di@@ ate .
Mary has a new lo@@ ver .
what co@@ lo@@ r is Mary &apos;s scar@@ f ?
may I eat another pi@@ e@@ ce of cake ?
you never get a second chance to make a first im@@ pres@@ sion .
he &apos;s all@@ er@@ gi@@ c to cats .
get on your k@@ ne@@ es .
is there a problem I should know about ?
Dan is now wanted by the police .
you &apos;d better tell the truth .
it was rain@@ ing h@@ e@@ av@@ ily when I got up this morning .
I called her , but the line was busy .
I have a coat , but I don &apos;t have a hat .
I can &apos;t leave off smoking .
you are was@@ hing di@@ sh@@ es .
this won &apos;t sol@@ ve anything .
sometimes T@@ on@@ y vis@@ ited his family .
ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ence can now co@@ ll@@ ect information from so@@ ci@@ al me@@ di@@ a and the inter@@ n@@ et to help des@@ ig@@ n@@ ers understand what the public likes .
I love to tr@@ av@@ el .
Tom has a b@@ right car@@ e@@ er as a me@@ dic@@ al doctor .
C@@ ro@@ w@@ ds f@@ illed the stre@@ ets car@@ r@@ ying b@@ an@@ n@@ ers .
Oh ! mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous !
I learned it from you .
J@@ i@@ m seems to know the art of making friends with girls .

ch@@ ic@@ ken po@@ x is a com@@ m@@ on si@@ ck@@ ness in children .
I can &apos;t tell you exactly how long it will take .
H@@ ence , lo@@ ath@@ ed m@@ el@@ an@@ cho@@ ly .
I was bo@@ red because I had seen the movie before .
I believe that story .
Tom &apos;s grand@@ mother looks h@@ e@@ al@@ thy .
they &apos;re all in there .
many years ago fl@@ ying used to be gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous . now it &apos;s just a pain in the n@@ ec@@ k !
I ad@@ mi@@ re your per@@ s@@ ever@@ ance and det@@ er@@ min@@ ation .
he gave her a p@@ ec@@ k on the ch@@ ee@@ k .
our gu@@ es@@ ts are in a hurry .
he went to bed .
which one should I use ?
Tom in@@ tro@@ du@@ ced Mary to his mother .
in E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e , people re@@ g@@ ard p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al@@ ity as a matter of c@@ ou@@ r@@ se .
get a room already !
most of these are mine .
Tom &apos;s dog has four legs .
many young people are out of work in that country .
why don &apos;t I have a bo@@ y@@ friend ?
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
we had to make a dec@@ is@@ i@@ on .
B@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant !
I think this is b@@ es@@ ide the point , right now .
this is a dog .
I need to go sho@@ p@@ ping .
language is the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of a n@@ ation &apos;s ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence .

I miss you .
I am a cat . I don &apos;t have a name yet .
you can &apos;t have your cake and eat it .
just as I thought something was ru@@ st@@ ling there , a cat lea@@ ped out of the bus@@ h .
this place is p@@ acked !
I really like that gu@@ y .
they speak French in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c .
a black and wh@@ ite dog bit me .
the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens immediately pre@@ par@@ ed everything to de@@ f@@ end the city .
I &apos;m going to join a d@@ em@@ on@@ str@@ ation .
I had a good sleep last night .
come on , T@@ on@@ y .
I don &apos;t feel so spec@@ i@@ al .
Tom is res@@ p@@ ected by everybody .
this book is much more us@@ e@@ ful than that one .
A@@ ch@@ i@@ ev@@ ing a nice w@@ el@@ d b@@ ea@@ d is not wi@@ th@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
someone sp@@ i@@ ked her drink .
if he &apos;s still ali@@ ve , he &apos;d be very old by now .
would you tr@@ us@@ t them ?
I wish I could live in a house that nice .
how long have you been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
I &apos;m what the world c@@ all@@ s an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
that seems like a lot .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
it &apos;s a little cold today .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
where exactly do you live ?
I went to the pos@@ t office .
I &apos;d like to w@@ el@@ come you all ab@@ o@@ ard .
I will let you know in adv@@ ance .
he is m@@ il@@ es away .
what a wonder@@ ful morning ! I feel on top of the world .
I can &apos;t help myself .
I was there last night .
they who dre@@ am by day are co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ant of many things which es@@ cap@@ e those who dre@@ am only by night .
are you sure that you want to go there ?
he went back home .
this morning the weather is cl@@ ou@@ d@@ y .
how could you not say something ?
in all li@@ k@@ el@@ i@@ hood , we shall be away for a few days .
what v@@ e@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les do you u@@ su@@ ally g@@ row ?
if I were rich , I &apos;d buy a car .
he broke down when he heard the bad news .
I don &apos;t know which bu@@ tt@@ on to p@@ ush .
she is next to them .
he doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I &apos;m well aw@@ are of the ri@@ s@@ k .
I love c@@ ab@@ b@@ age !
stop c@@ or@@ rec@@ ting me .
Tom put too much sugar in my coffee .
th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of people wanted to know the answer .
there are some things that are difficult to trans@@ late .
are they taking care of you ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a new car .
we want n@@ at@@ ur@@ al @-@ s@@ oun@@ ding trans@@ l@@ ations , not word @-@ for @-@ word di@@ rec@@ t trans@@ l@@ ations .
this is how you get res@@ ul@@ ts .
it kept me from reading .
I was sho@@ cked at the s@@ ad news .
I think this is mine .
how come you didn &apos;t tell me Tom was going to Boston with us ?
girls like to show off their fine clothes .
this is Tom &apos;s thir@@ d trip to Australi@@ a .
Mary ir@@ oned her sk@@ ir@@ t .
she saw him at the station .
I &apos;m playing with my friends .
I played so@@ c@@ c@@ er yesterday .
I can &apos;t go out .
I sw@@ ear to God , if one more person here s@@ ays &quot; gi@@ ant ro@@ bo@@ t , &quot; you &apos;re all as good as dead .
I think that Tom is still sleeping .
I don &apos;t think I can keep that promise .
you used to smoke , didn &apos;t you ?
strange to say , the teacher didn &apos;t s@@ cold me .
I don &apos;t feel like it .
they started all at once .
he went ab@@ o@@ ard the plan@@ e .
everybody is against me .
his be@@ h@@ av@@ i@@ or did not c@@ or@@ respon@@ d with his words .
he s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ed his door sh@@ u@@ t .
I &apos;m living with my un@@ c@@ le this month .
we &apos;re not rel@@ ated .
I wasn &apos;t respon@@ si@@ ble .

Tom and Mary are b@@ ack@@ p@@ ack@@ ers .
is there s@@ om@@ e@@ body you want to talk to ?
they had no money left .
are you telling me Tom doesn &apos;t do that anymore ?
he plays the gu@@ it@@ ar .
mine is better than yours .
I &apos;m aw@@ ake .
I am not un@@ der@@ standing what the au@@ th@@ or is trying to say .
I guess I didn &apos;t want to dis@@ ap@@ point you .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
don &apos;t sleep with the win@@ do@@ ws open .
they told me they &apos;d be home on Mon@@ day .
my husband and daughter are fast as@@ le@@ ep .
cut that out !
we &apos;ve known each other since we were children .
he looked up at the c@@ e@@ il@@ ing .
hi@@ king is a good ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se .
he is a b@@ lo@@ o@@ d@@ y fo@@ ol .
I liked your friends .
few of her friends live in K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
you &apos;re un@@ am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous .
once a week , Mary me@@ ets up with her friend .
I had a good teacher .
Tom can sleep an@@ y@@ where .
even Tom was speaking French .
for a year , Tom sh@@ u@@ tt@@ led between Paris and B@@ er@@ li@@ n .
she came to her s@@ en@@ ses in hospital .
mother often got angry with us .
I was ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ ed .
I ate my s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h .
this is a good question .
she laugh@@ ed at me .
don &apos;t open the door for anyone .
I can &apos;t tr@@ us@@ t my t@@ ex@@ t@@ book .
the glass is fu@@ l@@ l of water .
it hur@@ ts ter@@ ri@@ b@@ ly .
you worry about your we@@ ight too much .
Tom read the letter .
f@@ ear is ess@@ enti@@ al for sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al .
please give me a sp@@ are bl@@ an@@ k@@ et .
why do I have to sing with Tom ?
Tom and Mary vis@@ ited S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ av@@ ia .
M@@ e@@ di@@ t@@ ation doesn &apos;t cost anything , but it takes time .
the news sp@@ read little by little .
we are Australi@@ an .
give me a kis@@ s .
he was ig@@ n@@ or@@ ant of the fact .
I get m@@ ad at his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance .
give me a hand with this .
Tom arrived late at the station .
he was sick , but he went to school .
I am not as@@ ham@@ ed of my father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
they &apos;re all n@@ or@@ m@@ al .
I was born on O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 1@@ 0@@ th , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 2 .
T@@ hom@@ as has a picture of his family on his des@@ k .
not all my cl@@ as@@ s@@ m@@ ate like the food in the c@@ a@@ f@@ et@@ er@@ ia .
you &apos;re hur@@ ting him .
is it really too difficult to turn off your ph@@ on@@ es ?
France , I love you !
you &apos;re free to go .
I want you to come with me .
I s@@ tru@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to get out of the sub@@ way .
you seem to know all the an@@ sw@@ ers .
I was aw@@ ake .
she has to take in the w@@ ai@@ st of her p@@ ants a bit .
a person vi@@ e@@ ws things differ@@ ently ac@@ c@@ or@@ ding to whether they are rich or poor .
he liked everything about her .
do you want me to talk to Tom about what &apos;s going to happen ?
I &apos;m thinking of going ab@@ ro@@ ad next year .
I already know how to dance .
could you do me a fav@@ our please ?
I have to@@ o@@ th@@ a@@ ch@@ e .
what kind of g@@ am@@ es do you cre@@ ate ?
Tom sho@@ ws his c@@ am@@ er@@ a to his brother .
ac@@ tu@@ ally , I &apos;m kind of busy .
do you own a computer ?
S@@ u@@ ck@@ ers !
even th@@ ou@@ g@@ h he has turned tw@@ enty , he &apos;s still too ti@@ mi@@ d to ch@@ at with girls .
it fe@@ el@@ s we@@ ir@@ d , doesn &apos;t it ?
G@@ il@@ ded re@@ ins do not make for a better h@@ or@@ se .
how heavy you are !
the si@@ ze of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se is un@@ im@@ ag@@ in@@ able .
how do you read this k@@ an@@ j@@ i ?
our t@@ ask has been easy so far , but it will be difficult from now on .
she will make a good wife .
I could have pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ed this .
tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing was much more difficult in those days .
this is what I bought in S@@ pain .
I &apos;m very interested in the ev@@ o@@ lu@@ tion of the d@@ in@@ o@@ s@@ au@@ r@@ s .
Tom &apos;s co@@ o@@ king .
Dan dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed that his wife had been un@@ fai@@ th@@ ful .
I will meet you at the station at 1@@ 0 a@@ .@@ m .
any play o@@ pen@@ ing to bad re@@ vi@@ e@@ ws won &apos;t last long .
you can &apos;t smoke in here .
how is it that you know so much about Japanese history ?
I was surprised to hear of his fai@@ lu@@ re .
you should wash fruit before you eat it .
Tom po@@ u@@ red Mary a cu@@ p of coffee .
he fell as@@ le@@ ep du@@ ring class .
put the eg@@ gs in the fri@@ dge .
I want a hot sho@@ wer before I go back to work .
I ad@@ m@@ itted that she was right .
didn &apos;t I tell you so ?
we can believe everything .
there is no telling exactly when the ear@@ th was born .
I &apos;ll tell my m@@ om on you !
we used to sit on these ste@@ ps and talk .
we have all kin@@ ds of time .
it is too dark for me to read .
why didn &apos;t you read the m@@ ag@@ az@@ ine ?
she &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
I can &apos;t understand why you are so cri@@ ti@@ cal of him .
my br@@ ain is fri@@ ed .
you aren &apos;t in a hurry , are you ?
are you afraid of it ?
she al@@ lo@@ w@@ ed him to go alone .
I think Tom killed himself .
my sk@@ ir@@ t is too long .
do you speak German ?
watch the f@@ r@@ on@@ t .
I have only just arrived .
I have another en@@ g@@ ag@@ ement .
how does Tom plan to help ?
are you st@@ a@@ y@@ ing for dinner ?
Tom will be here every day .
is this baby a he or a she ?
whether to trans@@ late is a m@@ or@@ al choice of the trans@@ l@@ at@@ or . sometimes things are better to be left alone in the language which pro@@ du@@ ced them .
this man &apos;s r@@ am@@ bl@@ ings are the fu@@ r@@ th@@ est from the truth I &apos;ve ever heard !
I can hear you l@@ ou@@ d and clear .
we &apos;ll do the same for you .
Tom is con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly compl@@ ain@@ ing .
Tom never learned how to read and write .
we &apos;ve looked ever@@ y@@ where , haven &apos;t we ?
are you telling me you don &apos;t love me anymore ?
it &apos;s really co@@ ol here .
Ch@@ ar@@ les pe@@ el@@ s your b@@ an@@ an@@ a .
I ad@@ vi@@ se you to be p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al .
I had a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood .
Tom wants to get a t@@ at@@ too on his ch@@ est .

she used to keep a di@@ ary , but doesn &apos;t anymore .
s@@ om@@ e@@ body thre@@ w a bri@@ ck through my window .
is it possible to buy po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es here ?
over the w@@ ee@@ k@@ end I went out to dinner with this married couple that I met through a mu@@ tu@@ al friend and we all w@@ ound up going home together .
I couldn &apos;t bring myself to tell her the truth .
I s@@ at at the b@@ ar .
Tom wants people to p@@ ity him .
I had to c@@ li@@ m@@ b over the f@@ ence .
I &apos;ll do anything I can for Tom .
I ad@@ vi@@ se you to not dis@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ age me !
she needed the enti@@ re afternoon for that job .
I thought that was the right thing to do .
lo@@ sing your health is wor@@ se than lo@@ sing your money .

I know that you don &apos;t speak French very well .

thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .

Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants .
the li@@ br@@ ar@@ i@@ an said we needed to be qu@@ i@@ et .
B@@ er@@ n@@ ard of Ch@@ ar@@ tr@@ es used to say that we are like d@@ war@@ f@@ s on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ s of gi@@ ants , so that we can see more than they , and things at a gre@@ at@@ er dist@@ ance , not by vi@@ r@@ tu@@ e of any sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ness of si@@ ght on our part , or any ph@@ y@@ si@@ cal dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion , but because we are c@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed high and r@@ ai@@ s@@ ed up by their gi@@ ant si@@ ze .

pri@@ ces went up .

boys will be boys , girls will be girls .
I had some things to do .
have you ever made a p@@ i@@ e before ?
my leaving early made them feel sorry .
you said you fi@@ gu@@ red out why .

how could anybody not like this ?
go to the park .
they need him .
God is .
can I have a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a , please ?
I know where you live .
I think what you say is true .
I think we should all go to Tom &apos;s house .
that was because my watch was five minutes s@@ low .
that &apos;s only a to@@ y .

I used to look up to him , but not anymore .
swimming is easy for me .
S@@ el@@ ect ac@@ tion for Ch@@ r@@ is .
are you lo@@ sing your mind ?
how was the f@@ light ?
when did I tell you that ?
by the time you got there , the sun had set .
why don &apos;t I call you ?
all languages are e@@ qu@@ al , but English is more e@@ qu@@ al than the others .
you must take your coat in case it should become cold .

it &apos;s si@@ m@@ p@@ le and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive .
where do you think we came from ?
I &apos;m sorry , I couldn &apos;t hear you .
in the sea , there are as many fish as you like .
you don &apos;t need to w@@ ra@@ p it .
maybe we really are alone .

I have once lived in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing , but now live in S@@ e@@ ou@@ l .

I think I shouldn &apos;t have married you .
I was born on J@@ u@@ n@@ e 4 , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 4 .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
the f@@ ly running on the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r doesn &apos;t worry about its re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion on the po@@ in@@ ts of its legs from which it s@@ its and r@@ un@@ s ; but on the contr@@ ary , it se@@ es on the s@@ mo@@ o@@ th sur@@ face a qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ty of very small things which inter@@ est it and which we con@@ fu@@ se with d@@ us@@ t and g@@ ri@@ me .

three children were playing in the park .
I don &apos;t think his story is true .
didn &apos;t your parents teach you anything ?
this is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
who cr@@ as@@ hed the party ?
did Tom like Boston ?
you &apos;ve changed since I saw you last year .

I don &apos;t drink a lot of beer .
I &apos;m so wor@@ n out !

as he gre@@ w exc@@ ited , he spoke more and more r@@ ap@@ id@@ ly .
this is not the first time this has happened .
hurry up , guys .

H@@ u@@ m@@ ans are strange an@@ im@@ als .

that couple was made for each other .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here again .
Oh cr@@ ap , it &apos;s past the con@@ su@@ me @-@ by date . that &apos;s why you thre@@ w up !
he felt in his po@@ ck@@ et for his w@@ all@@ et .

a s@@ ai@@ lo@@ r is at sea much of the time .
you &apos;re not safe here .
nice shot !
you can easily id@@ enti@@ f@@ y him because he is very t@@ all .
you should call the police .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
ang@@ er is a for@@ m of m@@ ad@@ ness .

Tom didn &apos;t want to lose .

there is g@@ end@@ er e@@ qu@@ al@@ ity in this country .
try to sleep .
keep Tom safe .
I wish she &apos;d stop smoking .

speaking French is difficult .
he comm@@ and@@ ed me to leave the be@@ d@@ room immediately .
be@@ coming too f@@ at is not good for one &apos;s health .
S@@ t@@ ev@@ e did not come home .

how are you g@@ on@@ n@@ a deal with it ?
I was im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed with her work .
I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed my mother to l@@ end me her car .

Tom seems young .
what does any of that have to do with me ?
she dis@@ liked her husband .
I was able to do it .
I don &apos;t want to see her n@@ a@@ ked .
tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing is easy these days .
Tom bought three bo@@ tt@@ les of red wine .
what &apos;s wrong with being n@@ a@@ ked ?
Tom is fi@@ gh@@ ting c@@ anc@@ er .
why don &apos;t you eat v@@ e@@ g@@ et@@ ab@@ les ?

there are many fruit v@@ end@@ ors on the way .
I haven &apos;t seen you in d@@ on@@ key &apos;s years !
you &apos;re very l@@ on@@ ely .

when the school had no books or paper or pen@@ c@@ il@@ s , she wrote the al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et on the gr@@ ound with a sti@@ ck .

pri@@ ces are d@@ ou@@ ble what they were ten years ago .

Tom always had to win .
you should stop .
Tom pre@@ tend@@ ed he had a g@@ u@@ n .
as soon as I have it , I &apos;ll forward it to you .
this is for your pro@@ t@@ ec@@ tion .

I think we should s@@ ell our old car .
I realize that there &apos;s a problem .
like a lea@@ f in the au@@ tu@@ m@@ n bre@@ e@@ ze .
the t@@ one of do@@ g@@ m@@ ati@@ s@@ m is in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by pro@@ f@@ ound ig@@ n@@ or@@ ance .

I &apos;m ad@@ dic@@ ted to ni@@ co@@ t@@ ine .

the U@@ .@@ S@@ . pres@@ ident &apos;s pass@@ port is black , not b@@ lu@@ e like an av@@ er@@ age ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en &apos;s .
this could have un@@ in@@ tend@@ ed con@@ se@@ qu@@ ences .
who does she think she is ?
Tom dec@@ l@@ in@@ ed to com@@ ment .
we have consi@@ dered your propos@@ al , and we have decided that we are not able to re@@ du@@ ce the pri@@ ce .
c@@ anc@@ el that .
those were his ac@@ tu@@ al words .
we know where he is .
R@@ e@@ pe@@ ti@@ tion is the mother of all learning .

keep the dog out .
I like these ch@@ ai@@ r@@ s .
are you coming in or not ?
I &apos;m about to go out .
you can &apos;t help him .
I remember the war@@ m@@ th of his ar@@ ms .
why are you really doing this ?
you &apos;re very cl@@ ever .
I &apos;ll sleep on the fu@@ t@@ on .
Tom is not a her@@ o .
you &apos;re b@@ lo@@ c@@ king my vi@@ e@@ w .
that &apos;s not good .
we could &apos;ve hel@@ ped Tom .
Mary opened her pu@@ r@@ se and looked around in it .
I &apos;ve thought about it , and what we &apos;re doing is just not right , so let &apos;s break up after today .
you don &apos;t seem very pl@@ e@@ as@@ ed .
why don &apos;t you see for yourself ?
have you put on sun@@ s@@ cre@@ en ?
let &apos;s play ch@@ ess another time .
I &apos;ve never had a tr@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic accident .
a kis@@ s is the best way to keep sil@@ ent while saying it all .
with this tal@@ is@@ man , you can ward off any and all ev@@ il sp@@ i@@ ri@@ ts .
Tom has no money at all .
Tom has never d@@ anced with Mary .
I want to talk to her .
you ought to have been more careful .
they &apos;re just students .
I believ@@ ed you .
where exactly did you go ?
I have been sil@@ ent for a long time .
I think he &apos;s happy .
nobody can believe in you more than yourself .
you &apos;re res@@ ou@@ r@@ c@@ e@@ ful .
have you ever sli@@ pped on a b@@ an@@ an@@ a pe@@ el ?
I &apos;ll probably come by c@@ a@@ b .
she &apos;s in@@ s@@ ec@@ ure .
I &apos;m not in@@ v@@ in@@ ci@@ ble .
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on the pic@@ ni@@ c with him .
come over here and sit down .
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
I bought a watch and an em@@ p@@ ty box .

H@@ i , S@@ us@@ an . how are you ?

after a bit of go@@ o@@ gl@@ ing , I su@@ sp@@ ect that what you said may not be true .
the ci@@ r@@ c@@ us is in town .
Tom is wor@@ ried sick about Mary .
I &apos;d like to gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate next s@@ pr@@ ing .
the go@@ ods were trans@@ por@@ ted by shi@@ p .

the s@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts have not found any ex@@ plan@@ ation for the m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
that &apos;s your half .
Tom has cut his fin@@ ger .
we cho@@ se a hotel near the sub@@ way .

Tom came up with an in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous idea .
