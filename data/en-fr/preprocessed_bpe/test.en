I wish J@@ i@@ m would be@@ have himself .
I don &apos;t drink wine .

Tom is s@@ mar@@ ter than me .
there &apos;s no hurry .
Tom sli@@ pped and ne@@ ar@@ ly fell .
is it an ac@@ tion movie ?
I &apos;m going to have to think about that one .
he sti@@ cks to his pr@@ in@@ ci@@ pl@@ es .
I &apos;m high@@ ly im@@ pr@@ ess@@ ed .
Tom doesn &apos;t like che@@ ese .
women like co@@ l@@ or@@ ful u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ as .
thank you , that &apos;ll be all .
he decided to r@@ ent his pro@@ per@@ ty to that company .
N@@ a@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s ar@@ my has adv@@ anced to M@@ o@@ s@@ co@@ w .

N@@ a@@ ok@@ o is a fast r@@ un@@ n@@ er .
you &apos;re lucky to have a job .
it is not so much the h@@ e@@ at as the hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty that makes me tired .
I never for a moment im@@ ag@@ in@@ ed that I &apos;d be sin@@ gl@@ ed out for a fu@@ l@@ l body se@@ ar@@ ch .

do you have any as@@ pi@@ ri@@ n on you ?
experience is important .
j@@ ack was too l@@ az@@ y to give them a call , so they decided to walk without him .
why didn &apos;t you do it ?
it is on this point that our op@@ in@@ ions di@@ f@@ f@@ er .

didn &apos;t Tom tell you anything ?
I know what a st@@ a@@ pl@@ er is .
you worry about everything .

the children bu@@ il@@ t a s@@ and c@@ as@@ t@@ le on the b@@ each .
what did he do to you ?
please be sure to take one do@@ se three times a day .
Tom or@@ dered a beer .
when I was a col@@ le@@ ge student , I always pu@@ ll@@ ed all @-@ ni@@ gh@@ ters before t@@ es@@ ts .
I wanted to know why you didn &apos;t come yesterday .
that gu@@ y has a s@@ cre@@ w lo@@ o@@ se !
Tom didn &apos;t know how to re@@ act .
he had dinner by himself .
O@@ ri@@ on is s@@ a@@ f@@ ely back to Earth .
everybody had a good year .
I told him not to come back .
I would rather not go .
the neigh@@ b@@ ors s@@ ent their k@@ id on a l@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ tic trip to I@@ rel@@ and this summer .
he is just a k@@ id .

I am star@@ ting this evening .

I &apos;ll meet you down at the station tomorrow .
a few days later , he came .
can you read what that s@@ ays ?

I know you want to go home .
just 1@@ 3 people ? that &apos;s all ?
th@@ an@@ ks to this book , I learned some interesting f@@ ac@@ ts about this in@@ s@@ ect .
I think Tom is aw@@ ake .
there was always too much su@@ per@@ flu@@ ous writing in his ess@@ ays .
I fi@@ gu@@ red you &apos;d be here .
we ch@@ at@@ ted together .
have you tried this water ?
to become a pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al b@@ an@@ j@@ o play@@ er , you need to spend th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s of hours practi@@ c@@ ing .
I must &apos;ve par@@ ked my car el@@ se@@ where .
at the most , the trip will cost $ 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 .
you speak my language .
he doesn &apos;t like to wait until the last moment to do something .
this is correct .
she had to sh@@ are a be@@ d@@ room with her sister .
is he a friend of yours ?
these ch@@ ai@@ r@@ s are different .
how can one be ser@@ i@@ ous with the world when the world it@@ sel@@ f is so ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous !
&quot; look - there &apos;s a fire ! ! &quot; E@@ x@@ cl@@ ai@@ m@@ ed Dan .
you can &apos;t buy this me@@ dic@@ ine without a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
do you remember his tel@@ e@@ phone number ?
Tom , who is kind , will be glad to do anything for me .
it won &apos;t be easy to forget you .
are you looking for your parents ?
I want to thank you for hel@@ ping me .
what are you doing now ?
those who have a long hair own a h@@ ai@@ r@@ dri@@ er .
you were scar@@ ed , weren &apos;t you ?
is it your bi@@ ke ?
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
what stu@@ f@@ f is this j@@ ac@@ k@@ et made of ?
call a doctor quickly !
Tom told the police everything he knew .
I &apos;m not em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ed at all .
who would you like to speak to ?
I &apos;d like to help them if I can .
do you know where the others are ?
Tom pre@@ tend@@ ed that he didn &apos;t see it .
this car looks pretty co@@ ol .
have you ever c@@ li@@ m@@ bed M@@ t . F@@ u@@ j@@ i ?
she &apos;s was@@ hing di@@ sh@@ es .
did anyone hear me ?
I don &apos;t like tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing alone .
I think we &apos;re all a bit cu@@ ck@@ o@@ o .
I think Tom is am@@ us@@ ing .
I ate a light lunch .
what are you writing ?
I still have other things to do .
he changed his address .
you can tell me anything .
&quot; is he ali@@ ve or dead ? &quot; &quot; he &apos;s ali@@ ve . &quot;
tell me about your wife .
they are very comp@@ ati@@ ble .
it doesn &apos;t b@@ el@@ ong to you .
there &apos;s a table .
she worked for a rich man .
having finished the work , he went to bed .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV many times .
are you up ?
he was p@@ ati@@ ent .
the oper@@ ation was really touch and go there for a@@ while but the doctor thinks he &apos;ll pu@@ l@@ l through .
since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
my grand@@ father is still str@@ on@@ g@@ ly an@@ cho@@ red in my heart .
don &apos;t th@@ row anything on@@ to the floor .
no , just the one .
I &apos;m bre@@ as@@ t @-@ fe@@ e@@ ding my baby .
I always have a good sup@@ pl@@ y of ti@@ s@@ su@@ es in my po@@ ck@@ ets .
Tom is a re@@ b@@ el@@ li@@ ous boy .
I think I know the answer .
what &apos;s the ex@@ change r@@ ate today ?
I didn &apos;t know how to re@@ act .
look at it clo@@ sel@@ y .
P@@ u@@ a is sin@@ ging at ch@@ ur@@ ch .
you don &apos;t ... you don &apos;t talk to me like that .
I can walk to school in ten minutes .
Tom is hard up for money .
I can &apos;t promise anything , but I &apos;ll do my best .
thank you for making it so easy .
I want you to meet my parents .
my father doesn &apos;t eat fruit that much .
I &apos;m h@@ ang@@ ing a picture of my grand@@ mother on the w@@ all .
I don &apos;t know where to go or what to do .
you know everybody .
it si@@ m@@ pl@@ y doesn &apos;t b@@ ear thinking about .
we s@@ at on a b@@ en@@ ch in the park .
I rel@@ a@@ y@@ ed the m@@ ess@@ age to Tom .
you &apos;ll soon get used to speaking in public .
does that trouble you ?
are you laugh@@ ing at me ?
Tom was@@ h@@ es his hair every day .
Tom &apos;s friends called him Mr money b@@ ag@@ s .
we &apos;ll never know the truth about his death .
all you have to do is wait .
what is it this time ?
I took her ar@@ m .
it must be morning , for the bir@@ ds are sin@@ ging .
I would have bought that car if I &apos;d had the money .
this word is both a n@@ ou@@ n and a ver@@ b .
she ir@@ oned his shi@@ r@@ ts .
I think you should open an ac@@ coun@@ t here .
have you ever read any Ch@@ in@@ ese po@@ em@@ s ?
how do you know which one is yours ?
you won &apos;t go , will you ?
this is do@@ able .
as I thought , she &apos;s a vi@@ r@@ g@@ in !
I inter@@ pre@@ ted what he said in French into Japanese .
he put the box on the table .
co@@ o@@ king is interesting .
an@@ im@@ als can &apos;t tell what &apos;s real and what &apos;s f@@ ake .
he &apos;s writing a long letter .
you must take care of your dog yourself .
he en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed himself .
the res@@ ul@@ ts were ne@@ g@@ ative .
the Japanese eat ri@@ ce at least once a day .
I catch the fl@@ u every year .
that &apos;s why I s@@ ent for you .
it t@@ as@@ t@@ es very good .
Oh , I haven &apos;t decided what I &apos;m going to do yet .
at this time , there &apos;s no s@@ a@@ f@@ er place to be than right here .
there are many tou@@ ri@@ sts in the city on ho@@ li@@ days .
he likes w@@ al@@ king in the park .
do you think so ?
stay out of the water .
Tom closed the door of his be@@ d@@ room .
I have your s@@ che@@ du@@ le here .

I have little kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ is@@ try .
Tom promis@@ ed never to do that again .
