today is a new day !
I want you to get started right away .
do you see the six win@@ do@@ ws on the f@@ ac@@ ade ?
one should be res@@ p@@ ec@@ t@@ ful of other &apos;s b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ s rather than mo@@ ck them .
people u@@ su@@ ally die if you kill them .
it was working .
Tom needs us to show him the way .
just do your job .
the train was about to leave the station .
here is an at@@ om@@ ic po@@ wer pl@@ ant .
when the al@@ ar@@ m clo@@ ck goes off , I don &apos;t mo@@ ve .

Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence , fore@@ ver , dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed our Mary .
we im@@ port coffee from B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
but you cannot understand . how could you understand what it is to feel old ?
why do I believe you ?
you sp@@ read your a@@ f@@ fai@@ r@@ s too th@@ in .
those box sp@@ ea@@ k@@ ers have a good re@@ ver@@ b .
they were h@@ ang@@ ing on her words .
in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of compl@@ ain@@ ing , maybe you should help .
I think we can hand@@ le that .
I am de@@ e@@ pl@@ y interested in art .
you are old enough to know this .
I accep@@ ted his in@@ v@@ it@@ ation .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing your new s@@ ong .

can you believe this is really happen@@ ing ?
he p@@ aid the lo@@ an with inter@@ est .
I know you like cho@@ co@@ late .
I never me@@ ant for any of this to happen .
the de@@ er was running by it@@ sel@@ f .
for him , di@@ v@@ or@@ ce is a good in@@ v@@ en@@ tion , with one so@@ le dis@@ adv@@ an@@ t@@ age : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an comm@@ is@@ sion &apos;s re@@ comm@@ end@@ ations were ig@@ no@@ red .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .
that &apos;s d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ ful .

he is always ex@@ pres@@ si@@ on@@ less .
he has tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed around the world in ei@@ gh@@ ty days by himself .
bl@@ ame it on the weather .
I can ex@@ plain it to you , but I can &apos;t understand it for you !
sh@@ ame on you for your dis@@ c@@ ou@@ r@@ ag@@ ement !
he left the room without saying a word .
I &apos;d like to get me@@ dic@@ al in@@ sur@@ ance .
he went down the h@@ ill .

I &apos;m not scar@@ ed of women .
the angry mo@@ b over@@ turned car@@ s and sm@@ as@@ hed sto@@ re@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t win@@ do@@ ws .
I res@@ ig@@ n .
I know he is busy .
the man and his h@@ or@@ se that fell off the c@@ li@@ f@@ f were soon res@@ cu@@ ed .
she is very c@@ un@@ ning .
it was a com@@ promise .
he is ap@@ t to forget .
a bir@@ d in the hand is better than two in the bus@@ h .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
turn right at the next inter@@ s@@ ec@@ tion .
you look busy .
they all laugh@@ ed at their er@@ ro@@ r .
Tom didn &apos;t eat the app@@ le you gave him .
bir@@ ds have n@@ es@@ ts , sp@@ i@@ der@@ s have we@@ b@@ s , and hu@@ m@@ ans have fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p .
ten years have gone by .
I &apos;m tr@@ app@@ ed .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ t@@ ly takes another pi@@ e@@ ce of cake .
I left behind some important do@@ cu@@ m@@ ents for the company at home . sorry , but could you please go and get them for me now ?
&quot; listen to me , &quot; said the D@@ em@@ on , pl@@ ac@@ ing his hand u@@ po@@ n my head .
you should have stop@@ ped .
he s@@ pr@@ ain@@ ed his an@@ k@@ le .
Tom looks ol@@ der than he really is .
I was watching the s@@ cen@@ e ho@@ l@@ ding my bre@@ at@@ h .
Mary got to know her bo@@ y@@ friend in Paris .
hand in your p@@ ap@@ ers .
are you still married ?

she turned a p@@ age of her book .
yes , you should w@@ ear red li@@ p@@ sti@@ ck for V@@ al@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day .
Tom isn &apos;t invited to parti@@ es often .
you see the words that I t@@ y@@ ped on the s@@ cre@@ en , but you don &apos;t see the tears that I sh@@ ed over the k@@ e@@ y@@ bo@@ ard .
give me a ti@@ p .
what do you want to drink with your m@@ ea@@ l ?

I want to live in a c@@ as@@ t@@ le .

the win@@ do@@ ws were open .
Tom wanted to go home early .
I forgot my de@@ bit c@@ ard at home .
you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Mary thre@@ w a po@@ t@@ a@@ to through the window .
everyone des@@ er@@ ves a second chance .
I find that it &apos;s best to find a happy b@@ al@@ ance between ori@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ ity and sti@@ c@@ king to a st@@ ri@@ c@@ t st@@ and@@ ard .
I remember meeting her s@@ om@@ e@@ where .
I &apos;m br@@ in@@ ging home a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a .

it &apos;s a p@@ ity that you can &apos;t tr@@ av@@ el with us .
I wonder what happened to P@@ au@@ l .
you know where to find me if you need anything .
no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s b@@ lowing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we talked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .
don &apos;t you feel stupid now ?
Tom &apos;s phone can take pic@@ tures .
what do you want the m@@ ess@@ age to be ?
m@@ om said I caught a cold because I went out with w@@ et hair .
how many more for@@ ks do you need ?
r@@ ar@@ ely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful d@@ anc@@ er .
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed another chance .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ t@@ act you .
do you want to join me for lunch ?
all of these let@@ ters are ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed to you .
Tom knew where he had put his keys .
you could coun@@ t to ten when you were two .
I just found it .
Tom is laugh@@ ing .
do you know what day it is today ?
the poor cat was run over by a tru@@ ck .
I don &apos;t want to get invol@@ ved in that bus@@ iness .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed .
the boy was cl@@ ever enough to sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .
I appreciate your work .
the sy@@ ste@@ m is ri@@ gg@@ ed .
an ar@@ ti@@ st must have an eye for col@@ our .
Oh wo@@ w ! what &apos;s this , you &apos;re having lunch without me !
you sound tired .
maybe Tom is in love .
look at the m@@ et@@ er .
T@@ hom@@ as changed into pro@@ per clo@@ thing .
my mother bought two bo@@ tt@@ les of or@@ ang@@ e ju@@ i@@ ce .
taking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation , the res@@ ul@@ t is better than I exp@@ ected .
I guess right n@@ ine times out of ten .
that &apos;s a nice p@@ air of legs .
it is by this reason that he left school .
&quot; have you finished ? &quot; &quot; on the contr@@ ary . I haven &apos;t even started . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t like be@@ ef . ne@@ i@@ ther do I .
where did you go to school ?
please don &apos;t dis@@ tr@@ act me from my work .

I tell you a little secret .
I &apos;m not scar@@ ed at all .
he was ac@@ comp@@ an@@ i@@ ed by his girlfriend .
his office is near the train station .
Tom was s@@ it@@ ting under a tree , drin@@ king wine .
I &apos;ve been ho@@ ping to meet you .
don &apos;t work too hard !
can you wash my j@@ e@@ ans ?
do you speak M@@ al@@ t@@ ese ?
I &apos;m as cu@@ ri@@ ous as you are .
Oh , how we laugh@@ ed !
what &apos;s your o@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ ation ?
that picture does not do j@@ us@@ ti@@ ce to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is wi@@ se who ne@@ i@@ ther ho@@ p@@ es no@@ r fe@@ ar@@ s anything from the un@@ c@@ er@@ t@@ ain future .
our class has tw@@ enty @-@ five boys and tw@@ enty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
once I re@@ ti@@ re , I will de@@ dic@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba .
it &apos;s m@@ er@@ ely a jo@@ ke .
I do not have a sister .
S@@ am is two years y@@ oun@@ ger than Tom .

what does your father like ?
what a c@@ at@@ as@@ tr@@ op@@ he !
for the sh@@ ar@@ ks , we saw them , not by un@@ its , no@@ r by t@@ en@@ s , no@@ r by hun@@ dre@@ ds ; but by th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ s and by m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad@@ s . tr@@ us@@ t me , there are more sh@@ ar@@ ks in the sea than m@@ or@@ tal@@ s on land .
you should get up early .
love is ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed of everything that is not it@@ sel@@ f .
he &apos;ll be back in ten .
if I wanted to s@@ care you , I would have told you about what I dre@@ am@@ t about a few w@@ ee@@ ks ago .
you &apos;re not dead yet .
I know a good restaurant that &apos;s in@@ expensive .
who is the person in char@@ ge ?
trying to find h@@ app@@ iness only makes you un@@ happy .
I want to speak to a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
he av@@ eng@@ ed his dead father .
she liked that .
I &apos;m so@@ re all over .
why don &apos;t you sit down ?
stop sho@@ wing off !
the weather is very cold in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l .
I &apos;m doing you a fav@@ or .
you were afraid , weren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like the t@@ as@@ te of on@@ ions .
they never re@@ turned to their country .
when do you me@@ an to start ?
why do the stars tw@@ in@@ k@@ le ?
when I came home , he was watching TV .
she n@@ am@@ ed him Ch@@ ar@@ les .
she s@@ an@@ g better than him .
I made a propos@@ al .
what do you plan on doing tonight ?
I &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t do that .
there is milk in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or .
I don &apos;t know her address .
I don &apos;t bl@@ ame you for doing that .
I have a friend who lives in K@@ y@@ o@@ to .
I think you &apos;re too pic@@ k@@ y .

what exactly did you say ?
he set off to Paris .
the m@@ ess@@ en@@ ger left for L@@ on@@ don in secret .

I &apos;m all set .
my computer won &apos;t start any more .
I &apos;ve been in Boston for less than a month .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
did you find the differ@@ ence between these two p@@ ho@@ to@@ s ?
it seems that the rain@@ y se@@ as@@ on has set in .

they sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ed , even th@@ ou@@ g@@ h the building was des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed .

I hel@@ ped my parents with the h@@ ou@@ se@@ work .
he knows M@@ r@@ . D@@ av@@ id@@ son well .
get back to where you started .
that is of no use to me .
get me all the information you can on this matter .
I went to Boston by train .
maybe Tom should pay more attention in class .
you were sleeping , weren &apos;t you ?
there are no dr@@ u@@ gs here .

you always said you wanted to become a s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st . why didn &apos;t you ?
I was as@@ t@@ on@@ is@@ hed .

I &apos;ll be in the other room .

I don &apos;t see your name on the li@@ st .
he mis@@ sed class .
forget about this gu@@ y . there are a lot of men better than him in this world .
that &apos;s not a bad thing .
there has never been a n@@ ation that was not ev@@ en@@ tu@@ ally des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed .
we &apos;ll be working on that this week .
I &apos;m not very busy .
where can I ex@@ change fore@@ ig@@ n cur@@ r@@ en@@ c@@ y ?
may I be of ser@@ vi@@ ce ?
I wonder what I &apos;ll find in the box .
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
you are going too far .
dre@@ am@@ s always come out differ@@ ently .
it wasn &apos;t always easy for E@@ di@@ son to in@@ v@@ ent new things .
you look f@@ at .
my name &apos;s Tom .
what is the to@@ t@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of money you sp@@ ent ?
if it s@@ no@@ ws tomorrow , I will bu@@ il@@ d a s@@ no@@ w@@ man .
this fruit has an un@@ pl@@ e@@ as@@ ant sm@@ ell .
un@@ less I leave right away , I &apos;ll be late for my ap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment .
this is what you &apos;ve been waiting for .
is this your book ?
I can &apos;t help but feel par@@ tly respon@@ si@@ ble .
there &apos;s nothing to re@@ port .
all of them are good , so cho@@ o@@ se three books .
C@@ i@@ gar@@ et@@ te smoke bo@@ th@@ ers me a lot .
don &apos;t worry . I told you everything would be O@@ K .
he &apos;s no ori@@ g@@ in@@ al th@@ in@@ k@@ er , but si@@ m@@ pl@@ y im@@ it@@ ates what others have already said and done .
D@@ ec@@ em@@ b@@ er has thir@@ ty @-@ one days .
I can &apos;t pro@@ ve it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
is it difficult to learn Ch@@ in@@ ese ?
I &apos;m a f@@ an of German oper@@ a .
I met a friend while I was waiting for a bus .
that door won &apos;t open .
we &apos;re not fo@@ o@@ ls .
did you reco@@ g@@ ni@@ ze any of those people ?
an interesting propos@@ al . need to think it over .
he is a s@@ or@@ t of poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ an .
B@@ er@@ t &apos;s b@@ is@@ ex@@ u@@ al@@ ity was tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing Tom and exc@@ ited Mary .
many fore@@ ig@@ n@@ ers speak good Japanese .
Sami ac@@ ted alone .
how did you pu@@ l@@ l it off ?
the cur@@ few is at 1@@ 0 P@@ M .
he is not at home .
how is your daughter ?
they were dis@@ appointed that you could not come .
have you ever heard of this person .
you should be happy for me .
I hur@@ ried my clothes on .
can I make one ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation ?
you should put on some clothes .
don &apos;t give up .
I &apos;m going to do you a fav@@ or .
she p@@ ati@@ ently w@@ ai@@ ted for him .
let me in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself .
that was a good idea .
in Japan you can always catch a c@@ a@@ b , day or night .
why are you waiting here ?
there &apos;s a chance that t@@ a@@ p water may con@@ t@@ ain har@@ m@@ ful sub@@ st@@ an@@ ces like ch@@ l@@ or@@ ine and l@@ ea@@ d .
he &apos;s a s@@ cre@@ en@@ w@@ ri@@ ter .
drive on .
bus@@ iness is bus@@ iness !
it must &apos;ve been ex@@ t@@ re@@ m@@ ely pain@@ ful .
looking at that gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c , one can tell ex@@ t@@ re@@ m@@ ely easily that we are fol@@ lowing an ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ al g@@ ro@@ w@@ th .
I believe Tom will be ac@@ qu@@ it@@ ted .
promise me you won &apos;t to do anything stupid .
he doesn &apos;t even know that I exist .
it is de@@ gr@@ ad@@ ing for her .
a ser@@ ies of bl@@ as@@ ts re@@ du@@ ced the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory to ru@@ ins .
I wanted something to eat .
you &apos;re over@@ worked .
when I re@@ ali@@ zed it was rain@@ ing , I took my u@@ m@@ br@@ el@@ l@@ a .
she went to the mus@@ eu@@ m by t@@ a@@ x@@ i .
but the case n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess is , that those things der@@ i@@ ve their ori@@ g@@ in from the pro@@ x@@ y@@ s@@ m of the cr@@ u@@ ci@@ fi@@ x@@ i@@ on , and the theory de@@ du@@ ced th@@ er@@ e@@ from , which was , that one person could st@@ and in the place of another , and could per@@ for@@ m m@@ er@@ it@@ ori@@ ous ser@@ vi@@ ces for him .
the future is no longer what it used to be .
a father shouldn &apos;t shi@@ r@@ k his respon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties to his children .
how does it work ?
J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s two years ol@@ der than me .
he &apos;s in char@@ ge of the sal@@ es de@@ par@@ t@@ ment .
a s@@ ev@@ ent@@ h ch@@ or@@ d is com@@ pos@@ ed of four no@@ t@@ es .
Tom knew Mary wouldn &apos;t let him kis@@ s her .
we have different w@@ ays of thinking .
I like the kind of music that Tom plays .
we have nothing to f@@ ear but f@@ ear it@@ sel@@ f .
Mary will watch Tom .
I don &apos;t want to w@@ ake my neigh@@ b@@ ors .
how long were you there ?
the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic hit an ic@@ e@@ b@@ er@@ g .
that &apos;s why I need a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
the si@@ ght s@@ ent ch@@ ill@@ s of d@@ el@@ i@@ ght up my sp@@ ine .
&quot; are s@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts close to cl@@ on@@ ing a hu@@ man being ? &quot; &quot; not by a long shot . &quot;
A@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ing fore@@ ig@@ n we@@ b@@ s@@ it@@ es that didn &apos;t re@@ gi@@ st@@ er with the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is il@@ le@@ g@@ al in B@@ el@@ ar@@ us .
tell Tom that I don &apos;t want to talk to him .
he has more money than can be sp@@ ent .
these are my students .
fi@@ x the clo@@ ck on the w@@ all .
what is the t@@ all@@ est mountain in E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ e ?
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s a bit cold .
I can &apos;t drive a bus .
I &apos;m not going to lie to you .
I &apos;m going to buy a c@@ am@@ er@@ a for my daughter .
I want to be with Tom .
it &apos;s hard to learn a fore@@ ig@@ n language .
I &apos;m not a dis@@ b@@ el@@ i@@ ever .
I &apos;ve always w@@ on@@ dered what it &apos;d be like to have si@@ bl@@ ings .
you must o@@ be@@ y your parents .
I &apos;m really sorry about last night .
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom .
come on , you can do better than this !
we had to make the best of a bad deal .
I want to w@@ ear a tu@@ r@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k in this weather .
who was the girl you were with the other day ?
Al@@ low me to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce myself .
they all ob@@ j@@ ected to his propos@@ al .
I &apos;ll keep an eye on Tom .
I didn &apos;t know you were that good at French .
I should tell you something .
my father le@@ av@@ es for the Un@@ ited S@@ t@@ ates next W@@ e@@ d@@ n@@ es@@ day .

the fun@@ ds are not su@@ f@@ f@@ ici@@ ent for running a g@@ ro@@ c@@ er@@ y .
I mis@@ sed the two o &@@ a@@ pos@@ ;@@ clo@@ ck plan@@ e .
I had to make a choice .
do you think this ro@@ p@@ e is strong enough ?
the w@@ ound left a s@@ car on her ar@@ m .
did Tom tell you where to park ?
Tom is a C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an who lives in Australi@@ a .
we couldn &apos;t help feeling sorry for her .
many people like to tr@@ av@@ el .
I want you to know that Tom &apos;s important to me .
she &apos;s a bit of a s@@ no@@ b .
the accident came about through my car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
I &apos;m tired . it &apos;s been a long day .
I wasn &apos;t born here , but I sp@@ ent all of my early ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood here .
Tom would l@@ end you money if you asked him to .
she po@@ u@@ red a cu@@ p of te@@ a for me .
it &apos;s all the same to him .
that was stupid .
I must make an a@@ po@@ log@@ y to her .
where did you put the book I was reading ?
I want to become a w@@ it@@ ch .

why are you speaking in French ?
she is ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en at most .
what did you do with my book ?
Tom , my friend , I know that you loved me , but I could not be yours .
the G@@ re@@ at D@@ an@@ e is a bre@@ ed of d@@ om@@ es@@ tic dog known for its gi@@ ant si@@ ze .
I &apos;d like to ask you about a student of yours .
don &apos;t run .
the res@@ ul@@ t won &apos;t really be good .
the trouble is that glasses always get lost .
I can im@@ ag@@ ine how you felt .
don &apos;t leave your dog inside all day .
it &apos;s bus@@ iness as u@@ su@@ al .
when we arrived , all the st@@ or@@ es were closed .
will we be in time for the con@@ c@@ er@@ t ?
are you sure you don &apos;t want to come in ?
is this le@@ g@@ al ?
I felt thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
I don &apos;t want that .
nobody knows what happened to him .
K@@ ab@@ y@@ lie is a to@@ l@@ er@@ ant country un@@ like Al@@ ger@@ ia .
Tom is a g@@ e@@ o@@ gr@@ ap@@ her .
they were closed .
I want children .
and the te@@ a isn &apos;t good either .
you want me to wash my hands first , don &apos;t you ?
thank you for your kind words .

I have a friend who can speak French .
Sami is now able to sleep at night .

Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans believe that J@@ es@@ us is God .
I don &apos;t have to listen to you .
if you only had one more week to live , what would you spend your time doing ?
I thought this building was ab@@ and@@ oned .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I &apos;m really pr@@ ou@@ d of this .
when did you visit your friends ?
why do I have to do this by myself ?
I had my birthday party at a restaurant .
Tom has very short hair .
we need fl@@ our , sugar and eg@@ gs to make this cake .
